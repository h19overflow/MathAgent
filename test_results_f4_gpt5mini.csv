(a) Area function A(x):

(b) If A = 250 m^2, set the function equal to 250 and write as a quadratic in standard form:
x^2 + 25x + 100 = 250

x^2 + 25x − 150 = 0

(If you wish to solve for x: x = [−25 ± sqrt(25^2 − 4·1·(−150))]/2

- Inductive step: Assume P(k) is true, i.e. Box k has 2k + 1 cylinders. The pattern increases by 2 for the next box, so Box (k+1) has (2k + 1) + 2 = 2k + 3 = 2(k+1) + 1 cylinders. Thus P(k) ⇒ P(k+1).

- Vertices: (0,0), (3,3), (3,−2), (0,−2).
- Boundaries: x = 0 (left), x = 3 (right), y = −2 (bottom), y = x (top).
- So the original region is given by 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 and −2 ≤ y ≤ x.

Reflect in the x-axis: (x,y) → (x,−y). Replace y by −y in the inequalities:
- 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 (unchanged),
- −2 ≤ −y ≤ x.
Solve −2 ≤ −y ≤ x:
- from −2 ≤ −y we get y ≤ 2,
- from −y ≤ x we get −x ≤ y.

Final inequalities for the reflected region (a):
x ≥ 0, x ≤ 3, −x ≤ y ≤ 2.

  y = (1/2)x (through (0,0) and (4,2)),

- The triangle interior satisfies (testing a point like (2,2)):
  (1/2)x ≤ y ≤ 2x and y ≤ −x + 6 (and x ≥ 0).

Reflect in the x-axis: replace y by −y in each inequality:
- (1/2)x ≤ y becomes (1/2)x ≤ −y → y ≤ −(1/2)x,
- y ≤ 2x becomes −y ≤ 2x → y ≥ −2x,
- y ≤ −x + 6 becomes −y ≤ −x + 6 → y ≥ x − 6,
- x ≥ 0 remains x ≥ 0.

(a) Rate of change of speed for the first 20 s:
- The acceleration is constant on 0–40 s: a = Δv/Δt = (15 − 0)/40 = 15/40 = 3/8 = 0.375 m s−2.

(a) First 24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 h. The car's first segment is from O(0,0) to P(0.7,70), so its speed on that segment is
speed = change in distance / change in time = 70 / 0.7 = 100 km h^-1.
Since 0.4 h < 0.7 h, the first 24 minutes lie in this segment, so the rate = 100 km h^-1.

(b) Bus is linear from (0,150) to (3,0), so its equation is distance = 150 - 50 t. Set this equal to 70 to find t:
150 - 50 t = 70 => 50 t = 80 => t = 1.6 hours.

No, the range is not a reliable sole measure of dispersion here because it depends only on the minimum and maximum and ignores the other data. It is sensitive to extreme values/outliers. For these teams both means are equal (61.0 kg) but Team B’s larger range (30 vs 22) is driven by more extreme values; variance or standard deviation (which use all data) give a fuller picture.

- Monthly net salary = RM 3,800
- Monthly commission = RM 450
- Monthly rental income = RM 600
- He sets aside 10% of his salary as fixed monthly savings.

- Housing loan instalment (1) = RM 800
- Housing loan instalment (2) = RM 500
- Food expenses = RM 900
- Utility payments = RM 150
- Toll and petrol = RM 200
- Internet subscription = RM 100
- Eat at a luxury restaurant = RM 400
- Insurance expenses = RM 350

Step 1 — Calculate total monthly income
- Income = salary + commission + rental
- Income = 3,800 + 450 + 600 = RM 4,850

Step 2 — Calculate fixed monthly savings (10% of salary)
- Savings = 10% × 3,800 = 0.10 × 3,800 = RM 380

- Expenses = 800 + 500 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
- Expenses = RM 3,400

Step 4 — Total monthly outflow (expenses + fixed savings)
- Outflow = 3,400 + 380 = RM 3,780

Step 5 — Monthly surplus / deficit
- Surplus = Income − Outflow = 4,850 − 3,780 = RM 1,070

- Income: RM 4,850
- Fixed savings (10% of salary): RM 380
- Fixed/necessary expenses: RM 3,400
- Monthly surplus available to allocate: RM 1,070

Recommended use of the RM 1,070 surplus (example plan)
- Build emergency fund: RM 500 per month (until target reached; target = 3–6 months of essential expenses)
- Extra debt repayment (accelerate housing loan): RM 300 per month
- Long‑term investment / retirement top‑up: RM 170 per month
- Discretionary / fun money or buffer: RM 100 per month

(Other sensible alternatives: put more to investments or mortgage prepayment, or increase fixed savings from 10% to 15–20% if comfortable.)

Comments on surplus/deficit
- Encik Nabil has a healthy monthly surplus of RM 1,070 after his planned 10% salary savings and paying all listed expenses.
- He can use this surplus to: build an emergency fund (recommended first), pay down mortgage faster (reduces long‑term interest), increase retirement/investments, or increase insurance if coverage is insufficient.
- If he wants to improve his financial safety faster, he could reduce discretionary spending (for example the RM 400 “eat at a luxury restaurant”) and redirect that money to emergency savings or debt repayment.
- Aim: accumulate 3–6 months of essential expenses (essential ≈ expenses excluding discretionary items; using essentials ≈ RM 3,000 → emergency target ≈ RM 9,000–18,000). With RM 500 monthly to emergency fund he would reach RM 9,000 in 18 months.

Summary
- Monthly income RM 4,850; monthly outflow RM 3,780; monthly surplus RM 1,070.
- Surplus should be prioritized to emergency fund, extra loan repayment and investments; discretionary cuts (luxury restaurant) are an easy place to free more cash if desired.",2582,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

total monthly savings of RM250 compared to the

(b) Mrs Thong will not be able to achieve the
investment goal of RM500 000 with monthly
savings of RM250",6, Financial Management,English,yes,6,"The table (numbers in RM) gives Mrs Thong’s monthly net income and expenses:
- Salary = 6 000
- Expenses (monthly): house loan 500, car instalment 700, travel 500, rental 1 500, transport fares 900, utility bills 250, tolls 100, groceries 400, allowances for parents 600, savings 100, insurance 200.
- Total expenses = 5 750
- Income balance (leftover) = 250

(a) Does she spend her money wisely?

Step 1 — compute her saving rate:
- Monthly savings recorded = 100
- Savings rate = 100 ÷ 6 000 = 0.0167 = 1.67%

Step 2 — compare with a common recommendation:
- A common guideline is to save about 20% of income (20% of 6 000 = 1 200 per month).
- Mrs Thong’s 100 per month (1.67%) is far below that.

Step 3 — note other issues in the budget:
- She has a large rental outlay (1 500) plus a house/apartment loan (500) — paying both is unusual and suggests inefficiency.
- Transport-related costs (car instalment 700 + transport fares 900 = 1 600) are high.
- Income balance is only 250 — very little buffer for emergencies.

Conclusion (a): No. Based on the very low saving rate (1.67%), small emergency buffer and high recurring costs, she is not spending her money wisely and should reduce expenditures and increase savings.

(b) Can she buy a RM500 000 property in 6 years with current spending behaviour?

Interpretation: to have RM500 000 in 6 years (72 months) she would need to save:
- Required monthly saving = 500 000 ÷ 72 ≈ 6 944.44 per month.

What she currently saves at present behaviour:
- Current recorded savings = 100 per month → in 6 years: 100 × 72 = 7 200
- If she also were to save the current leftover income balance (250) instead of spending it, total monthly saved = 100 + 250 = 350 → in 6 years: 350 × 72 = 25 200

Compare with target:
- 7 200 is 1.44% of 500 000
- 25 200 is 5.04% of 500 000

Conclusion (b): No. With her current savings (100/month) she would only accumulate RM7 200 in 6 years; even if she redirected the leftover RM250 to savings (total 350/month) she would only reach RM25 200. Both amounts are far short of RM500 000. To reach RM500 000 in 6 years she would need to save about RM6 944 per month, which is unrealistic without a very large increase in income or drastic cuts in expenses.

Practical suggestions (brief):
- Reassess why she pays both rental and a house loan; eliminate duplication if possible.
- Cut discretionary travel/transport costs, consider cheaper car or refinance car loan.
- Aim to raise savings toward at least 20% of income (≈ RM1 200/month) as a start, and consider investing to earn returns if the goal is long-term (but investing still requires much higher contributions or longer time).",2410,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
