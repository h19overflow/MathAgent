(a) To write a function for the area, A, of the land, we multiply the length and the width:

A = (x + 20)(x + 5)
A = x(x + 5) + 20(x + 5)
A = x^2 + 5x + 20x + 100
A = x^2 + 25x + 100

Therefore, the function for the area of the land is A = x^2 + 25x + 100.

(b) If the area of the land is 250 m², we set A = 250 and write a quadratic equation in terms of x:

250 = x^2 + 25x + 100

To get the equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, we subtract 250 from both sides:

0 = x^2 + 25x + 100 - 250
0 = x^2 + 25x - 150

Chapter 1_Q2.png,"(a) A(0, –5)     (b) x = 3
(c) B(6, –5)     (d) (3, 4)","Okay, let's break down this quadratic function problem step-by-step.

The given quadratic function is f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5.

(a) Coordinates of point A:

Point A is the y-intercept, which occurs when x = 0.
f(0) = -(0)^2 + 6(0) - 5 = -5
So, the coordinates of point A are (0, -5).

(b) Equation of the axis of symmetry:

The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula x = -b / 2a.
In our case, a = -1 and b = 6.
x = -6 / (2 * -1) = -6 / -2 = 3
So, the equation of the axis of symmetry is x = 3.

(c) Coordinates of point B:

Since the line AB is parallel to the x-axis, points A and B have the same y-coordinate. Thus, the y-coordinate of point B is -5.
To find the x-coordinate of point B, we need to solve the equation f(x) = -5.
-x^2 + 6x - 5 = -5
-x^2 + 6x = 0
x(-x + 6) = 0
This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = 0 or -x + 6 = 0, which means x = 6.
We already know that x = 0 corresponds to point A. Therefore, the x-coordinate of point B is 6.
So, the coordinates of point B are (6, -5).

(d) Coordinates of the maximum point P:

The maximum point P lies on the axis of symmetry. So, the x-coordinate of P is 3.
To find the y-coordinate of P, we need to evaluate f(3).
f(3) = -(3)^2 + 6(3) - 5 = -9 + 18 - 5 = 4
So, the coordinates of the maximum point P are (3, 4).

Chapter 1_Q3.png,20 cm,"Let $A_T$ be the area of the triangle and $A_S$ be the area of the square.
Let $P_T$ be the perimeter of the triangle and $P_S$ be the perimeter of the square.

The base of the triangle is $4y$ cm and the height of the triangle is $(y+5)$ cm.
Therefore, the area of the triangle is:
$A_T = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4y \times (y+5) = 2y(y+5) = 2y^2 + 10y$.

The side of the square is $y$ cm.
Therefore, the area of the square is:
$A_S = y^2$.

The area of the triangle is more than the area of the square by 39 cm$^2$.
So, $A_T - A_S = 39$, which means:
$2y^2 + 10y - y^2 = 39$
$y^2 + 10y - 39 = 0$
We can solve this quadratic equation for $y$.
$(y+13)(y-3) = 0$
$y = -13$ or $y = 3$.
Since $y$ represents a length, it must be positive, so $y = 3$.

Now we need to calculate the perimeter of both shapes.
The square has sides of length $y = 3$ cm.
The perimeter of the square is $P_S = 4y = 4(3) = 12$ cm.

The triangle has a base of $4y = 4(3) = 12$ cm and a height of $y+5 = 3+5 = 8$ cm.
Since the triangle is isosceles, we can find the length of the other two sides using the Pythagorean theorem. Half the base is $12/2 = 6$ cm.
Let $s$ be the length of the two equal sides.
$s^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$
$s = \sqrt{100} = 10$
The two equal sides are each 10 cm long.
The perimeter of the triangle is $P_T = 12 + 10 + 10 = 32$ cm.

The difference in perimeter between the triangle and the square is:
$|P_T - P_S| = |32 - 12| = 20$ cm.

Chapter 2_Q3.png,1600 m^2,"Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

1.  Understand the Problem: We have a rectangular playground divided into two sections: a children's playground (colored) and an exercise area (blank). We're given the perimeter of the entire playground and need to find the area of the children's playground.

2.  Identify Given Information:

    *   The playground is rectangular.
    *   One side of the rectangle is 80 meters.
    *   The other side is x meters.
    *   The perimeter of the playground is 33004 meters.
    *   The children's playground is a triangle formed by half of the rectangle.

3.  Formulate Equations:

    *   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(length + width). So, 33004 = 2(80 + x).
    *   The area of a triangle is given by A = (1/2) * base * height. The children's playground is a right-angled triangle with base and height equal to the sides of the rectangle. So, the area of the children's playground will be (1/2) * 80 * x.

4.  Solve for x (the unknown side):

    *   33004 = 2(80 + x)
    *   33004/2 = 80 + x
    *   16502 = 80 + x

 (? + 2) cm","Okay, I will solve the math question step by step.

(a) Calculate and list the perimeters of the four semicircles, in terms of π.

The radius of the largest semicircle is 32 cm.
From the diagram, we can see that the radius of the semicircles are halved successively.
So, the radii of the four semicircles are 32, 16, 8, and 4 cm.
The perimeter of a semicircle is given by πr + 2r = r(π + 2), where r is the radius.
Perimeter of the first semicircle = 32(π + 2) cm
Perimeter of the second semicircle = 16(π + 2) cm
Perimeter of the third semicircle = 8(π + 2) cm
Perimeter of the fourth semicircle = 4(π + 2) cm

(b) Based on the answer from (a), show that the generalisation for the perimeters of the four semicircles is 2^(6-n)(π + 2); n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... .

When n = 0, the perimeter is 2^(6-0)(π + 2) = 2^6(π + 2) = 64(π + 2) = 2*32(π + 2), which is incorrect.  The first semicircle has perimeter 32(π+2)
The general formula given in the question 2^(6-n)(π + 2) is incorrect. The series should be 32, 16, 8, 4. So the series goes as 32(π+2), 16(π+2), 8(π+2), 4(π+2).  Since 32=2^5, 16=2^4, 8=2^3, 4=2^2. 
Therefore, the general term can be written as 2^(5-n)(π+2), where n=0, 1, 2, 3.

Let's test with the calculated values from (a)
If n=0, 2^(5-0)(π+2)=2^5(π+2)=32(π+2)
If n=1, 2^(5-1)(π+2)=2^4(π+2)=16(π+2)
If n=2, 2^(5-2)(π+2)=2^3(π+2)=8(π+2)
If n=3, 2^(5-3)(π+2)=2^2(π+2)=4(π+2)

Therefore, the generalisation for the perimeters of the four semicircles is 2^(5-n)(π + 2), n = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(c) Calculate the perimeter, in cm, of the 8th semicircle.
Using the formula derived above, the perimeter of the nth semicircle is 2^(5-n)(π+2).
For the 8th semicircle, n=7.
Perimeter = 2^(5-7)(π+2) = 2^(-2)(π+2) = (1/4)(π+2) cm.

a_n = 3 + (n-1)2
a_n = 3 + 2n - 2

Chapter 4_Q2.png,39,"We are given the Venn diagram representing the universal set ξ, and its subsets P, Q, and R.
We are also given that n(Q) = n((P U R)').
We need to find n(ξ).

From the Venn diagram, we have:
n(Q) = 4k + 2 + 1 + 5 = 4k + 8
(P U R)' is the complement of (P U R), which means it is the region outside the union of P and R. In the Venn diagram, this corresponds to the region that contains only elements of Q, that are not in P and not in R, and any element in ξ that is not in P, Q, or R. Thus, n((P U R)') = 4k + 2k.
Therefore, n((P U R)') = 4k + 2k.

We are given that n(Q) = n((P U R)').
So, 4k + 8 = 4k + 2k
4k + 8 = 6k
8 = 6k - 4k
8 = 2k
k = 4

Now that we have the value of k, we can find the number of elements in each region.

B' = A ∪ C - (A ∩ B) - (B ∩ C)
From the Venn diagram, the elements in B' are 2, 5, 12, Thus
n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12 + (elements outside of A U B U C)
Assuming the Universal set is A U B U C, then n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12 = 19
Therefore, we have n(B') = 19.
Since n(B') = n(B ∩ C), we have 19 = y-1+12 or 9 = y-1
Which gives the value of y as n(B ∩ C) = y - 1 + 12.
But we know that n(B') = 19 and n(B ∩ C) = 9. There must be an error in the assumption of  n(B ∩ C) = y-1 + 12.
According to the Venn Diagram, B ∩ C = {9}. So n(B ∩ C) = 9.
According to the question, n(B') = n(B ∩ C).
B' = {2,5,12} U {A - B} U {C-B}
Then, n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12 = 19
From n(B') = n(B ∩ C). Then, 19 = y - 1 + 12
Then n(B ∩ C) = 9 and n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12 =19
The equation must be wrong in the quesiton. Let solve it using n(A') = n(A ∩ C)

A'=4+12+9=25. n(A n C) = 5+12 = 17. The equation is still wrong in the question.
So we use the correct n(B intersection C) =9
n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12 = 19
So we have the universal set: 2 + 5 + y - 2 + y - 1 + 4 + 9 + 12 = 29 + 2y - 3 = 26+2y
n(B) = 4 + y - 2 + 9 = y + 11
n(B') = n(Universe) - n(B) = 26+2y - (y + 11) = 15 + y
So n(B') = 15 + y = n(B ∩ C) = 9
y = -6
Since sets are not negative numbers, there must be something wrong with the given.
Let us proceed with the assumption. Since n(B intersection C) = 9
y-1 =9; y=10

(b) n(A ∪ B ∪ C)

n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A ∩ B) - n(A ∩ C) - n(B ∩ C) + n(A ∩ B ∩ C)
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2 + (y - 2) + 5 + 4 + (y - 2) + 9 + 5 + (y - 1) + 12 - (y-2) - (y-1) -9 + (y-1)
Substituting y = 10:
n(A U B U C) = 2+4+5+4+8+9+5+9+12 = 58

n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2+4+5+9+12+(y-2)+(y-1)
=32+10-2+10-1
=49

Answer:
(a) y = 10
(b) n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 49
n(A U B U C) = 2 + (y-2) + 4 + 5 + (y-1) + 9 + 12 = 2 + 8 + 4 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 12 = 49

(iii) 16","Okay, let's analyze the three graphs and answer the questions.

(a) Graph (a):

(i) V and n(V):
The vertices are the points in the graph.  So, V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
The number of vertices, n(V) = |V| = 5.

(ii) E and n(E):
The edges are the lines connecting the vertices. E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7}.
The number of edges, n(E) = |E| = 7.

(iii) Sum of degrees:
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.
Degree(1) = 2
Degree(2) = 3
Degree(3) = 2
Degree(4) = 3
Degree(5) = 2
Sum of degrees = 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12.
Alternatively, the sum of degrees = 2 * n(E) = 2 * 7 = 14. There was an error in counting the degrees.
Degree(1) = 2
Degree(2) = 3
Degree(3) = 2
Degree(4) = 3
Degree(5) = 2
Sum of degrees = 2+3+2+3+2 = 12.
There is an error because the sum of degrees should be twice the number of edges.
Going to recount the degrees again:
Degree(1) = 2
Degree(2) = 3
Degree(3) = 2
Degree(4) = 3
Degree(5) = 2.
Oh I see my mistake, I did not count properly for the double check using number of edges.
1-2, 1-5
2-3, 2-4, 2-5
3-4
4-5

I think the degrees are:
degree(1) = 2
degree(2) = 3
degree(3) = 2
degree(4) = 3
degree(5) = 2
2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12, not 14.

The number of edges is 7, so the sum of degrees should be 14 = 2 * 7
The listed degrees add to 12. There must be an error.

1 is connected to 2 and 5. degree(1) = 2
2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 5. degree(2) = 4
3 is connected to 2, 4. degree(3) = 2
4 is connected to 2, 3, 5. degree(4) = 3
5 is connected to 1, 2, 4. degree(5) = 3
Sum of degrees = 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14

(b) Graph (b):

(i) V and n(V):
V = {P, Q, R, V, W, U, T, S}
n(V) = 8

(ii) E and n(E):
E = {(P, W), (Q, W), (Q, R), (R, V), (V, W), (V, U), (U, T), (S, T), (S, U)}
E = {PW, QW, QR, RV, VW, VU, UT, ST, SU}
n(E) = 9

(iii) Sum of degrees:
Degree(P) = 1
Degree(Q) = 2
Degree(R) = 2
Degree(V) = 3
Degree(W) = 3
Degree(U) = 3
Degree(T) = 2
Degree(S) = 2
Sum of degrees = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 18

(c) Graph (c):

(i) V and n(V):
V = {A, B, C, D, E, F}
n(V) = 6

(ii) E and n(E):
E = {AF, FE, ED, BC, CD, BE, AB}
n(E) = 7

(iii) Sum of degrees:
Degree(A) = 2
Degree(B) = 2
Degree(C) = 2
Degree(D) = 2
Degree(E) = 3
Degree(F) = 2
Sum of degrees = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 13
There is again an error because sum of degrees must be equal to 2 * n(E) = 2*7 = 14

Degree(A) = 2
Degree(B) = 2
Degree(C) = 2
Degree(D) = 2
Degree(E) = 3
Degree(F) = 2
Sum = 2+2+2+2+3+2 = 13, error.

Degree(A) = 2
Degree(B) = 2
Degree(C) = 2
Degree(D) = 2
Degree(E) = 3
Degree(F) = 2

Looks like I made a mistake again. The number of edges must be 7 so 2 *7 = 14 should be the sum of the degrees.

A is connected to F and B so it is degree 2.
B is connected to A, C, E so it is degree 3
C is connected to B and D so it is degree 2.
D is connected to C and E so it is degree 2.
E is connected to D, F, B so it is degree 3.
F is connected to A and E so it is degree 2.
Sum of degrees = 2+3+2+2+3+2 = 14.

(b) Route P > Q > S because I can save RM35 and

(a) (i) the most economical route.

We need to find the route from P to S with the lowest total cost. Let's examine the possible routes and their costs:

1.  P -> S: Cost = RM200
2.  P -> Q -> S: Cost = RM50 + RM115 = RM165
3.  P -> R -> S: Cost = RM130 + RM65 = RM195

Comparing the costs, the route P -> Q -> S has the lowest cost (RM165).

Therefore, the most economical route is P -> Q -> S.

(a) (ii) the route that takes the shortest time.

We need to find the route from P to S with the shortest total travel time, including transit time at the transit airports (45 minutes = 0.75 hours).

1.  P -> S: Time = 0.8 hours
2.  P -> Q -> S: Time = 1 hour + 1.4 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.15 hours
3.  P -> R -> S: Time = 1.5 hours + 1.1 hours + 0.75 hours = 3.35 hours

Comparing the travel times, the route P -> S has the shortest time (0.8 hours).

Therefore, the route that takes the shortest time is P -> S.

Chapter 5_Q3.png,"Route A > C > D > E because it is a safer route even
though Lani had to cycle 300 m more","The question asks us to find the best route for Lani to cycle from her house at A to school at E. The best route is usually the shortest. We are given the distances of different road segments. The segment BE is a municipal road, while AB, AC, CD, and DE are roads in the housing estates. We need to consider the total distances for different routes.
Route 1: A -> B -> E
Distance = AB + BE = 400 m + 1.1 km = 400 m + 1100 m = 1500 m
Route 2: A -> C -> D -> E
Distance = AC + CD + DE = 350 m + 800 m + 650 m = 1800 m
Comparing the two routes based on distance, Route 1 is shorter (1500 m) than Route 2 (1800 m).
Since BE is a municipal road, Lani may be able to cycle faster on this road than on the housing estate roads.
Therefore, the best route for Lani to cycle to school is A -> B -> E because it is the shortest route with a distance of 1500m, and it uses the municipal road BE, where cycling might be faster.

Final Answer: The best route is A -> B -> E. The distance is 400 m + 1100 m = 1500 m. This route is shorter than A -> C -> D -> E, which has a distance of 350 m + 800 m + 650 m = 1800 m. Also, BE is a municipal road, which might be better for cycling.

5 x – 1
(b) x >= 2, y >= 0, y < –x + 6","First, consider the graph (a). The coordinates of the vertices of the shaded region are (0,0), (5,-1), and (5,-5).

After reflection in the y-axis, the coordinates of the vertices become (0,0), (-5,-1), and (-5,-5).

The inequalities representing the reflected region are determined by the equations of the lines forming the boundary and the shaded region.
The line passing through (0,0) and (-5,-5) has the equation y=x. Since the region is above the line, the inequality is y >= x.

The line segment representing the horizontal line has endpoints (0,0) and (-5,-1). The equation is y = -1. Since the region is below the line, the inequality becomes y <= -1.
However, this line segment is part of the line y=-1, and the region is above y=-5 so this segment is not y=-1. It is y = -1 for x in the range -5 < x < 0.
Consider the vertical line segment passing through (-5,-1) and (-5,-5). The equation of the vertical line is x = -5. Since the region is to the right of the line, the inequality is x >= -5.

Next, look at the graph (b). The coordinates of the vertices are (-6,0), (0,0), and (-2,4).
The line passing through (-6,0) and (0,0) is the x-axis with the equation y=0. Since the region is above the line, the inequality becomes y >= 0.
The line segment is a vertical line x=-2. The region is to the left so x<=-2.
The line passing through (-6,0) and (-2,4) is given by
(y-0)/(x+6) = (4-0)/(-2+6)
y/(x+6) = 4/4 = 1
y = x+6, or y-x=6 or x-y=-6. Since the line is dashed, the inequality is y < x+6 or y - x < 6

Thus the inequalities are: x <= -2, y >= 0, and y < x+6.
Alternatively, x >= -6, and the line passes through (-2,4)
y = mx +c
0 = -6m + c
4 = -2m +c
4 = 4m
m =1
0 = -6 +c
c =6
So y = x +6
So y - x < 6 (since it is a dotted line)
y>=0
x<=-2

Part (a): y >= x, x >= -5, y <= 0.
However, 0 >= x. The point (5,-1) becomes (-5,-1). The line equation is y= -1/5 x
y >= -5, x = -5
y = x
The point (5,-5) becomes (-5,-5). The equation is y= x and x = -5.
The inequalities are y >= x, x >= -5 and y <= -1

Chapter 6_Q2.png,"(a) x + y <= 500 (b) x <= 3y or 3y >= x
(c) y >= 200","Okay, I will analyze each diagram and determine the inequalities that define the shaded region.

(a)
First, let's find the equation of the line. We know it passes through the origin (0,0) and the point (-4,2).
The slope of the line is (2-0)/(-4-0) = 2/(-4) = -1/2.
So, the equation of the line is y = (-1/2)x, or 2y = -x, which can be written as x + 2y = 0.
Since the line is solid, the inequality will include an ""equal to"" part.
We need to determine if the shaded region is above or below the line. Let's test the point (-4,0), which is in the shaded region.
If we substitute x = -4 and y = 0 into x + 2y, we get -4 + 2(0) = -4, which is less than 0.
Therefore, the inequality for the line is x + 2y <= 0.
The vertical line is at x = -4. Since it is a dashed line, the inequality does not include an ""equal to"" part.
The shaded region is to the right of x = -4. So, the inequality is x > -4.
The inequalities that satisfy the shaded region in diagram (a) are: x + 2y <= 0 and x > -4.

(b)
The lines intersect at (0,4).
The line on the left passes through (-2,0) and (0,4).
The slope is (4-0)/(0-(-2)) = 4/2 = 2. The y-intercept is 4.
The equation of the line is y = 2x + 4.
Since the region is above the line, the inequality is y >= 2x + 4.
The line on the right passes through (3,0) and (0,4).
The slope is (4-0)/(0-3) = 4/(-3) = -4/3. The y-intercept is 4.
The equation of the line is y = (-4/3)x + 4.
Since the region is above the line, the inequality is y >= (-4/3)x + 4, or 3y >= -4x + 12, which simplifies to 4x + 3y >= 12.
The inequalities that satisfy the shaded region in diagram (b) are: y >= 2x + 4 and 4x + 3y >= 12.

(c)
The top line passes through (1,0). It's a horizontal line, so its equation is y = 0.
Since the shaded region is below the line, the inequality is y <= 0.
The bottom line passes through (3,0) and (0,-2).
The slope is (-2-0)/(0-3) = -2/(-3) = 2/3. The y-intercept is -2.
The equation of the line is y = (2/3)x - 2.
Since the region is above the line, the inequality is y >= (2/3)x - 2, or 3y >= 2x - 6, which simplifies to 2x - 3y <= 6.
The inequalities that satisfy the shaded region in diagram (c) are: y <= 0 and 2x - 3y <= 6.

(a)
First, reflect the shaded region in the x-axis.
The vertices of the reflected region are (0,0), (3,2), (3,-3), and (-2,0).
The line passing through (0,0) and (3,3) in the original graph becomes the line passing through (0,0) and (3,-3) after reflection.
The equation of the line passing through (0,0) and (3,-3) is y = -x. Since the shaded region is above the line, the inequality is y >= -x or x+y >= 0.
The line passing through (-2,0) and (0,0) becomes the line passing through (-2,0) and (0,0) after reflection, which is y=0. Since the shaded region is above y=0, the inequality is y >= -2.
The vertical line is x=3, so the inequality is x <= 3.
The horizontal line is y=-2, so the inequality is y >= -2.

Therefore, the inequalities are:
x <= 3
y >= -2
x + y >= 0

(b)
First, reflect the shaded region in the x-axis. The vertices of the reflected region are (0,0), (2,-4), and (4,-2).
Line 1: passes through (0,0) and (2,4). After reflection, it passes through (0,0) and (2,-4).
The equation is y = -2x. The shaded region is above the line, so y >= -2x or 2x+y >= 0.

Line 2: passes through (2,4) and (4,2). After reflection, it passes through (2,-4) and (4,-2).
The slope is (-2 - (-4))/(4-2) = 2/2 = 1.
The equation is y - (-2) = 1(x-4) => y+2 = x-4 => y = x-6.
The shaded region is above the line, so y <= x-6 or x - y >= 6.

Line 3: passes through (0,0) and (4,2). After reflection, it passes through (0,0) and (4,-2).
The slope is -2/4 = -1/2.
The equation is y = -x/2. The shaded region is above the line, so y <= -x/2 or x+2y <= 0.
x+2y <= 0.

The inequalities are:
2x + y <= 0
x - y <= 6
x + 2y >= 0
The inequalities after reflection are:

(a)  To calculate the rate of change of speed (acceleration) for the first 40 seconds, we need to find the gradient of the speed-time graph during that interval.

From the graph, at t = 0, speed = 0 m/s and at t = 40, speed = 15 m/s.

Acceleration = (Change in speed) / (Change in time)
Acceleration = (15 - 0) / (40 - 0)
Acceleration = 15 / 40
Acceleration = 3 / 8
Acceleration = 0.375 m/s²

(b) To calculate the distance travelled at uniform speed, we need to consider the time interval where the speed is constant.  From the graph, the uniform speed of 15 m/s occurs between t = 40 seconds and t = 120 seconds.

Uniform speed = 15 m/s

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 15 × 80
Distance = 1200 metres

(c) To describe Encik Merisat's journey for the period of 2.5 minutes, we need to convert minutes to seconds:  2.5 minutes = 2.5 × 60 = 150 seconds. We should describe each stage of the journey:

Stage 1 (0-40 seconds): Encik Merisat's car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of 15 m/s.
Stage 2 (40-120 seconds): The car travels at a constant speed of 15 m/s for 80 seconds.
Stage 3 (120-150 seconds): The car decelerates uniformly from 15 m/s to rest in 30 seconds.

(a) 0.375 m/s²
(b) 1200 metres
(c) Encik Merisat's car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of 15 m/s in the first 40 seconds. Then, the car travels at a constant speed of 15 m/s for the next 80 seconds. Finally, the car decelerates uniformly from 15 m/s to rest in the last 30 seconds.

The rate of change in distance is the speed.
For the first 24 minutes, we need to find the distance travelled by the car.
24 minutes = 24/60 hours = 0.4 hours.
The car starts at point R, which is 150 km. At time t=3 hours, the car is at position 0 km.
The car travels from O to P in 0.7 hours where O is 0 km and P is 70 km.
The slope of the line OR gives the speed of the tour bus.
The equation of the tour bus line is:
distance = (70/0.7) * time = 100 * time.
The slope of the car is
(0-150)/(3-0.7) = -150/2.3 = -65.217 km/h
The rate of change in distance is the speed
Since the car travels from R to B, it covers 150 km in (3 - t) hours.
But the first 24 minutes is from time t to (t + 0.4) hours.
The line representing the car is from (t,70) to (3,0).
Equation of the line: y = mx + c
m = (0-70)/(3-t) = -70/(3-t)
The equation is y - 0 = (-70/(3-t)) (x-3) where x is the time.
The distance at t is 70.
The question asks rate of change for the first 24 minutes of the car.
However we note that in the diagram the car starts at point R and moves to the origin B from time t=0.7 to time t=3.
Since we want the rate of change of distance in the first 24 minutes.
Rate of change = Speed.
Distance travelled by car is from point (0.7, 0) to (3, 150) but in opposite direction from (3,0) to (0.7,70).
The speed of the car is given by (150-70) / (3-0.7) = 80 / 2.3 = 34.782 km/h
Since speed is constant, in the first 24 minutes, the speed is 34.782 km/h.
The rate of change in distance for first 24 minutes (0.4 hrs) is -65.21 km/h.

(b) The value of t.
The tour bus travelled 70 km and the car travelled 150-70 = 80 km at time t.
Speed of the tour bus is 70/0.7 = 100 km/h.
Speed of the car is 80/(3-t) km/h but also -70 / (3-t).
The point Q(t, 70) is where they meet. The coordinate is the same.
Then the speed of car from R to Q is  (150-70) / (t)
so 80 km/h = (150-70)/(3-t), then 80(3-t) = -70. But this doesn't work.
Distance of tour bus to P is 70 and time is 0.7.
Distance from R to Q is 150 - 70 = 80 km in time t to 3.
150-70/(3-t)

Let's calculate the speed of the bus from 0 to 0.7 hours which equals 70km/0.7hours = 100km/hr. After 0.7 hours the bus stays still at a position of 70km.

Let's calculate the speed of the car from t to 3 which equals (150 - 70)/(3-t) = 80km/3-t. After t hours, the car goes to location 0 so we can assume its going back from distance 150 to zero or distance 70 to zero.
Therefore, (3-t) = (70/80) * (3-0.7)

The distance of the bus from O to P = 70 and O to A from car at t = 0 = 150 . Time for car and bus to get to 70km is different! and its 0.7hours for the bus!
We know that car speed from R to B is (150km-0)/(3-t)=(150km/hr). Also, know speed equals slope which we found in previous part is -70 / (3-t).
Therefore we have equation of meeting point at point Q:  Car must equal Bus for value to meet. therefore Bus location after going 70 at point P MUST = Car Location after 70 at point Q. 0 -> 70 must = at 0 -> 150.

70 / 0.7 must equate to: x-150km  / = (3 - x)=y.

70 at a slope is (3-0.7hrs)= 2.3hr and
  150 at B slope is 3-y;
y at point q where distance equal to 70km therefore is from 0 -> to 3 = 0 therefore
The speed of Car must equation to be -80 at the change of speed of 2.3hr and 2.3+y;

Bus travel in 0.7 the same ammount of speed! the point is in 3.
We should find average. point Q, which is 70km with a travel time is (Average(3/2+0.7/2 +))

t = (3+0.7)/2
t = 1.85
Let's check the speeds at this time
speed of the car is 80 / (3-1.85) = 80 / 1.15 = 69.56 km/h
and the bus is constant, so bus is incorrect

Bus distance: 70 km/0.7hours = 100; the distance = km / hour - at the end they will travel the 70 distance at any hour, until 3. or distance will be still =70km until the end. Car will move down!

Therefore the car distance: is slope - equation -70 ( distance to complete)  / 3-= change in time! t therefore, 70/-2.3. y = 3+2.2 = 5.3 = x. this must = bus.
Therefore time,  is 1.15!

(c) The rate of change in distance, in km h¯¹, of the car for the last 80 km.
The last 80 km is when the car travels from 80 km to 0 km. From Q to B.
The coordinates of Q is (t, 70) and B is (3, 0). The distance is 70 km and time is (3-t).
Since we dont have the answer for 't'. we will say 80 last distance is from 80 from meeting to the last distance.  Q which to distance = Q! - 70/
(3km-t)!

rate= (3-t!/- 110+-) .
(7-)

Since the question states to use for the LAST 80KM. The speed must equation =80

Chapter 7_Q3.png,(a) 8 seconds (b) 17,"(a) The motorcycle travels at a uniform speed between 2 seconds and 10 seconds.
Duration = 10 - 2 = 8 seconds.

(b) Let the distance travelled by the car be D_car and the distance travelled by the motorcycle be D_motorcycle.
The distance travelled is the area under the speed-time graph.

For the car:
The car travels with uniform acceleration from 0 to t seconds.
D_car = area of the triangle with base t and height 10
D_car = (1/2) * t * 10 = 5t

For the motorcycle:
The motorcycle travels with uniform acceleration from 0 to 2 seconds, then with uniform speed from 2 to 10 seconds, then with uniform acceleration from 10 to t seconds.
The speed at 2 seconds is 4 m/s.
The speed at 10 seconds is 4 m/s.
The speed at t seconds is 10 m/s.

D_motorcycle = area of triangle with base 2 and height 4 + area of rectangle with length 10-2 = 8 and height 4 + area of triangle with base t-10 and height 10-4 = 6
D_motorcycle = (1/2) * 2 * 4 + 8 * 4 + (1/2) * (t-10) * 6
D_motorcycle = 4 + 32 + 3(t-10)
D_motorcycle = 36 + 3t - 30
D_motorcycle = 6 + 3t

Given that D_car = D_motorcycle
5t = 6 + 3t
5t - 3t = 6
2t = 6
t = 3

However, this value of t is smaller than 10, which is not possible according to the graph.
Let's assume that the motorcycle's speed at 2 seconds is greater than 0.

D_car = (1/2) * t * 10 = 5t

The motorcycle travels with uniform acceleration from 0 to 2 seconds, then with uniform speed from 2 to 10 seconds, then with uniform acceleration from 10 to t seconds.
The speed at 2 seconds is 4 m/s.
The speed at 10 seconds is 4 m/s.
The speed at t seconds is 10 m/s.

D_motorcycle = area of trapezium with parallel sides 0 and 4 and height 2 + area of rectangle with length 10-2 = 8 and height 4 + area of triangle with base t-10 and height 10-4 = 6
D_motorcycle = (1/2) * (0+4) * 2 + 8 * 4 + (1/2) * (t-10) * 6
D_motorcycle = 4 + 32 + 3(t-10)
D_motorcycle = 36 + 3t - 30
D_motorcycle = 6 + 3t

Given that D_car = D_motorcycle
5t = 6 + 3t
5t - 3t = 6
2t = 6
t = 3

Let's verify this calculation.
The distances travelled by the car and motorcycle are the same for the period of t seconds.
D_car = 5t
D_motorcycle = 6 + 3t
D_car = D_motorcycle
5t = 6+3t
2t = 6
t = 3
But this isn't right since the motorcycle has a constant speed from 2 to 10. It accelerates until it reaches 4 m/s, which occurs at t=2. It then remains at 4 m/s until t=10. Finally it accelerates from 10 to t.

Car Distance = 0.5 * t * 10 = 5t
Motorcycle distance = 0.5 * 2 * 4 + 4(10-2) + 0.5*(t-10)*6 = 4 + 32 + 3t -30 = 6 + 3t

Therefore 5t = 6 + 3t implies that t = 3 which is impossible since t is greater than 10.

Motorcycle: Area of trapezium + area of rectangle.
The points are (0,0), (2,4), (10,4), (t,10)
Distance of motorcycle = 0.5*(4+0)*2 + 4(10-2) + 0.5*(10+4)(t-10)
The points are (0,0), (2,4), (10,4), (t,10)
This doesn't work.
Using similar triangles, we have 6/ (t-10) = 4/2, so 6/(t-10) = 2 implies that 3 = t-10, so t = 13. Then 5(13) = 65. 6+3*13 = 45.

The motorcycle distance should be
2 + 32 + 3(t-10)= 6 + 3t.
5t= 6 + 3t implies t=3.
This can't be it

D_car = (1/2)*t*10 = 5t
D_motorcycle = (1/2)*2*4 + 4*(10-2) + (1/2)*(t-10)*(10-4) = 4+32+3*(t-10) = 36 + 3t -30 = 6 + 3t

5t = 6 + 3t
2t = 6
t=3

The area covered by car is less than the area covered by motorcycle before t=10 and the car distance can only increase after t=10 so we conclude the car graph is wrong

0.5 * 2 * 4 + (t - 2) * 4
5t = 4 + 4t - 8 = 4t - 4. Implies t = -4 - not possible.

(a)
First we need to calculate the total number of limes:
6+9+12+18+20+10+5 = 80

To find the range, we need to find the largest and smallest values of the diameter.
Largest diameter = 7.2
Smallest diameter = 6.0
Range = Largest - Smallest = 7.2 - 6.0 = 1.2

To find the interquartile range (IQR), we first need to find Q1 and Q3.
Q1 is the value below which 25% of the data falls.
25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20.  So we need to find the value that corresponds to the 20th lime.
The cumulative number of limes are:
6.0: 6
6.2: 6+9 = 15
6.4: 15+12 = 27
Since the 20th lime falls within the 6.4 category, Q1 = 6.4.

Q3 is the value below which 75% of the data falls.
75% of 80 = 0.75 * 80 = 60.  So we need to find the value that corresponds to the 60th lime.
The cumulative number of limes are:
6.0: 6
6.2: 6+9 = 15
6.4: 15+12 = 27
6.6: 27+18 = 45
6.8: 45+20 = 65
Since the 60th lime falls within the 6.8 category, Q3 = 6.8.

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 6.8 - 6.4 = 0.4

(b)
First we need to calculate the total number of participants:
12+18+21+20+21+8 = 100

To find the range, we need to find the largest and smallest values of the age.
Largest age = 18
Smallest age = 13
Range = Largest - Smallest = 18 - 13 = 5

To find the interquartile range (IQR), we first need to find Q1 and Q3.
Q1 is the value below which 25% of the data falls.
25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25.  So we need to find the value that corresponds to the 25th participant.
The cumulative number of participants are:
13: 12
14: 12+18 = 30
Since the 25th participant falls within the 14 category, Q1 = 14.

Q3 is the value below which 75% of the data falls.
75% of 100 = 0.75 * 100 = 75.  So we need to find the value that corresponds to the 75th participant.
The cumulative number of participants are:
13: 12
14: 12+18 = 30
15: 30+21 = 51
16: 51+20 = 71

**(a) Calculate the mean, range, variance, and standard deviation for the masses of the players in both teams.**

**Team A:** 48, 53, 65, 69, 70

*   **Mean:** (48 + 53 + 65 + 69 + 70) / 5 = 305 / 5 = 61 kg

*   **Range:** 70 - 48 = 22 kg

*   **Variance:**

    1.  Calculate the squared differences from the mean:
        (48-61)^2 = 169
        (53-61)^2 = 64
        (65-61)^2 = 16
        (69-61)^2 = 64
        (70-61)^2 = 81

    2.  Sum the squared differences: 169 + 64 + 16 + 64 + 81 = 394

    3.  Divide by the number of data points (n=5): 394/5 = 78.8

    Variance = 78.8 kg^2

*   **Standard Deviation:** Square root of the variance = sqrt(78.8) = 8.877 kg

**Team B:** 45, 47, 68, 70, 75

*   **Mean:** (45 + 47 + 68 + 70 + 75) / 5 = 305 / 5 = 61 kg

*   **Range:** 75 - 45 = 30 kg

*   **Variance:**

    1.  Calculate the squared differences from the mean:
        (45-61)^2 = 256
        (47-61)^2 = 196
        (68-61)^2 = 49
        (70-61)^2 = 81
        (75-61)^2 = 196

    2.  Sum the squared differences: 256 + 196 + 49 + 81 + 196 = 778

    3.  Divide by the number of data points (n=5): 778/5 = 155.6

    Variance = 155.6 kg^2

*   **Standard Deviation:** Square root of the variance = sqrt(155.6) = 12.474 kg

**(b) Is the range appropriate to be used as a measure of dispersion to represent the data above? Justify your answer.**

No, the range is not the most appropriate measure of dispersion in this case. The range only considers the highest and lowest values in the dataset and doesn't take into account the distribution of the other values. It's sensitive to outliers. Standard deviation is a better measure as it considers all the data points.

**(c) Determine the mass of which team has a greater dispersion from the mean.**

Team B has a greater dispersion from the mean. This is evident from the higher variance (155.6 kg^2 compared to 78.8 kg^2) and standard deviation (12.474 kg compared to 8.877 kg) for Team B.

Box K contains the letters S, E, R, and I.
Box L contains the numbers 4, 5, and 6.
We want to find the probability of getting an ""S"" from Box K or a multiple of 3 from Box L.
First, let's list all possible outcomes when choosing one card from each box. There are 4 possible outcomes from Box K and 3 from Box L, giving us a total of 4 * 3 = 12 possible outcomes.
The possible outcomes are:
(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6)
(E, 4), (E, 5), (E, 6)
(R, 4), (R, 5), (R, 6)
(I, 4), (I, 5), (I, 6)

Outcomes with ""S"" from Box K: (S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6)

Chapter 9_Q2.png,230,"Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

1.  **Probability of landing on red:** The wheel has 6 sectors, and 2 are red. So, the probability of landing on red is 2/6 = 1/3.

2.  **Probability of landing on yellow:** Since the rest are yellow, there are 4 yellow sectors. The probability of landing on yellow is 4/6 = 2/3.

3.  **Expected number of customers choosing from Box A:**  Out of the 450 customers, the expected number landing on red (and choosing from Box A) is (1/3) * 450 = 150 customers.

4.  **Expected number of customers choosing from Box B:**  Out of the 450 customers, the expected number landing on yellow (and choosing from Box B) is (2/3) * 450 = 300 customers.

5.  **Probability of a customer choosing RM10 from Box A:** In Box A, there are 20 RM50 vouchers and 5 RM10 vouchers, a total of 25 vouchers. The probability of choosing RM10 from Box A is 5/25 = 1/5.

6.  **Probability of a customer choosing RM10 from Box B:** In Box B, there are 10 RM50 vouchers and 20 RM10 vouchers, a total of 30 vouchers. The probability of choosing RM10 from Box B is 20/30 = 2/3.

7.  **Expected number of RM10 vouchers taken from Box A:**  Out of the 150 customers choosing from Box A, the expected number taking an RM10 voucher is (1/5) * 150 = 30 vouchers.

8.  **Expected number of RM10 vouchers taken from Box B:**  Out of the 300 customers choosing from Box B, the expected number taking an RM10 voucher is (2/3) * 300 = 200 vouchers.

9.  **Total expected number of RM10 vouchers needed:**  The total number of RM10 vouchers the Naga Shop needs to prepare is the sum of the expected number from Box A and Box B: 30 + 200 = 230 vouchers.

Answer: The Naga Shop needs to prepare 230 RM10 vouchers.

(b) 5/33","Here's the solution to the problem:

(a) Probability that both clubs selected are from Kedah.

Number of badminton clubs in Kedah = 14
Number of bodybuilding clubs in Kedah = 6
Total number of clubs in Kedah = 14 + 6 = 20

Number of badminton clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 11
Number of bodybuilding clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 2
Total number of clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 11 + 2 = 13

Number of badminton clubs in F.T. Labuan = 3
Number of bodybuilding clubs in F.T. Labuan = 2
Total number of clubs in F.T. Labuan = 3 + 2 = 5

Number of badminton clubs in F.T. Putrajaya = 5
Number of bodybuilding clubs in F.T. Putrajaya = 2
Total number of clubs in F.T. Putrajaya = 5 + 2 = 7

Total number of clubs = 20 + 13 + 5 + 7 = 45

Probability of selecting a badminton club from Kedah = 14/45
Probability of selecting a bodybuilding club from Kedah = 6/45
Therefore, the probability of selecting both clubs from Kedah = (14/45) * (6/45) = 84/2025
Simplified, 84/2025 = 28/675

(b) Probability that a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.

Federal Territories are F.T. Labuan and F.T. Putrajaya.
Total number of clubs in F.T. Labuan = 5
Total number of clubs in F.T. Putrajaya = 7
Total number of clubs in Federal Territories = 5 + 7 = 12

Total number of clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 13

Probability of selecting a club from the Federal Territories = 12/45
Probability of selecting a club from Negeri Sembilan = 13/45

Therefore, the probability of selecting a club from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan = (12/45) * (13/45) = 156/2025
Simplified, 156/2025 = 52/675

Chapter 10_Q2.png,"(a) Mrs Thong does not spend wisely because her
total monthly savings of RM250 compared to the
income of RM6 000 which is less than 10%.
(b) Mrs Thong will not be able to achieve the
investment goal of RM500 000 with monthly
savings of RM250","Here's the solution to the questions:

**(a) Does Mrs Thong spend her money wisely?**

To determine if Mrs. Thong spends her money wisely, we can look at the proportion of her income that she saves.  Her income is RM6000 and her savings are RM100 per month. This represents a small percentage of her income. She also spends a significant portion of her income on rental and transport.  While it's difficult to say definitively without knowing her personal circumstances and priorities, a savings rate of only RM100 per month suggests that she could improve her financial planning. A higher savings rate would be more indicative of wise spending.

**(b) Will Mrs Thong be able to achieve her long-term financial goal if she wishes to buy a property worth RM500 000 within 6 years with her current spending behaviour?**

First, calculate her current monthly savings: RM100
Then calculate her annual savings: RM100 * 12 months = RM1200
Next, calculate her savings over 6 years: RM1200 * 6 years = RM7200

Therefore, with her current savings, she will only save RM7200 in 6 years.
The property costs RM500,000.
Since RM7200 is far less than RM500,000, Mrs Thong will not be able to achieve her long-term financial goal of buying the property within 6 years if she maintains her current spending habits.
She needs to save RM500,000/6 years = RM83,333.33 per year
Or RM83,333.33/12 months = RM6944.44 per month.
She currently has RM250 balance per month.
So she has to save everything to achieve the goal in 6 years. Even though she does that, she still needs another RM6944.44-RM250=RM6694.44 per month.
Or she could consider taking a longer loan.

The AI correctly concluded she cannot achieve the goal and provided a sensible required-savings calculation (~RM6944.44/month), but it inconsistently used RM100 earlier and only later mentioned RM250, so full credit is not earned.
