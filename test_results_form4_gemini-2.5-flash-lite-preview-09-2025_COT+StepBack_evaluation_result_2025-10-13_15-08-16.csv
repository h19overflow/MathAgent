Chapter 1_Q1.png,(a) A = x2 + 25x + 100                 (b) x2 + 25x – 150 = 0,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves finding the area of a rectangular shape given its dimensions as algebraic expressions (Step 1a) and then setting up a quadratic equation based on a specific area value (Step 1b). The core mathematical principles are:
1. Geometry: Area calculation for a rectangle (Area = Length $\times$ Width).
2. Algebra: Function definition and algebraic manipulation, specifically expanding binomials (multiplication of linear expressions) to form a quadratic function.
3. Algebra: Solving/Formulating a quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The image depicts a piece of land that is rectangular in shape (implied by the mention of length and width).
Key features extracted from the text and diagram:
Length ($L$): $(x + 20)$ m
Width ($W$): $(x + 5)$ m
Area ($A$): Measured in $m^2$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The question has two parts:
(a) Write a function for the area, $A$, of the land in terms of $x$. This requires formulating $A(x) = L \times W$.
(b) If the area $A = 250 \, m^2$, write the resulting quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
(a) Area Function $A(x)$:
$A(x) = L \times W$
$A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5)$

(b) Quadratic Equation Formulation:
Set $A(x) = 250$:
$(x + 20)(x + 5) = 250$
Expand the left side and rearrange to meet the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Write a function for the area, $A \, m^2$, of the land.
$A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5)$
Use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to expand:
First: $x \cdot x = x^2$
Outer: $x \cdot 5 = 5x$
Inner: $20 \cdot x = 20x$
Last: $20 \cdot 5 = 100$

$A(x) = x^2 + 5x + 20x + 100$
Combine like terms:
$A(x) = x^2 + 25x + 100$

Part (b): If the area of the land is $250 \, m^2$, write a quadratic equation in terms of $x$ in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
Set $A(x) = 250$:
$x^2 + 25x + 100 = 250$
To get the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, subtract 250 from both sides:
$x^2 + 25x + 100 - 250 = 0$
$x^2 + 25x - 150 = 0$

In this equation: $a = 1$, $b = 25$, and $c = -150$.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) The function for the area, $A \, m^2$, of the land is:
A(x) = x^2 + 25x + 100

(b) The quadratic equation when the area is $250 \, m^2$, written in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, is:

(c) B(6, –5)     (d) (3, 4)","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves analyzing a quadratic function, finding its key features (vertex/maximum point, axis of symmetry), and using properties of lines (specifically, a horizontal line segment AB) related to the graph. The governing mathematical concepts are quadratic functions, vertex form, axis of symmetry, and function evaluation.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The problem provides the equation for the quadratic function: $f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5$.
The diagram shows a downward-opening parabola (consistent with the negative coefficient of $x^2$).
Key features indicated are:
1. Point P: The maximum point (vertex) of the parabola.
2. Line segment AB: A horizontal line segment connecting two points A and B on the parabola. Since AB is parallel to the x-axis, points A and B must have the same y-coordinate, let's call it $y_A = y_B = k$.
3. Point A: Appears to be on the y-axis, meaning its x-coordinate is 0, or perhaps just a point on the left side of the axis of symmetry. Based on the visual placement relative to the origin O, A seems to be the y-intercept, but we must confirm this by checking the coordinates relative to the axis of symmetry. Since A is shown explicitly on the graph and AB is horizontal, A and B are symmetric about the axis of symmetry.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to determine four specific components related to the function $f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5$:
(a) The coordinates of point A.
(b) The equation of the axis of symmetry.
(c) The coordinates of point B.
(d) The coordinates of the maximum point P.

The determination of A and B depends on knowing the $y$-coordinate $k$ of the line AB. Since the problem does not explicitly state the $y$-value for AB, we must look for clues. Point A is shown clearly intercepting the y-axis in the diagram (it lies on the vertical axis, $x=0$). We will proceed with the assumption that A is the y-intercept, as this is the only point whose coordinates can be directly calculated without further information.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
The quadratic function is $f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5$. This is in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a=-1$, $b=6$, and $c=-5$.

(b) Axis of Symmetry: The x-coordinate of the vertex (and the axis of symmetry) is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$.

(d) Maximum Point P (Vertex): The coordinates $(x_P, y_P)$ are found using $x_P$ from (b), and $y_P = f(x_P)$.

(a) Coordinates of Point A: Assuming A is the y-intercept, its coordinates are $(0, f(0))$.

(c) Coordinates of Point B: Since AB is parallel to the x-axis, $y_B = y_A$. Point B is the other point on the parabola with this y-coordinate. We will solve $f(x) = y_A$ for $x$ and find the $x$-coordinate that is not $x_A$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(b) Equation of the axis of symmetry:
$$x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{6}{2(-1)} = -\frac{6}{-2} = 3$$
The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 3$.

(d) Coordinates of the maximum point P:
The x-coordinate is $x_P = 3$.
The y-coordinate is:
$$y_P = f(3) = -(3)^2 + 6(3) - 5$$
$$y_P = -9 + 18 - 5$$
$$y_P = 4$$
The coordinates of the maximum point P are $(3, 4)$.

(a) Coordinates of point A:
Assuming A is the y-intercept, $x_A = 0$.
$$y_A = f(0) = -(0)^2 + 6(0) - 5 = -5$$
The coordinates of point A are $(0, -5)$.

(c) Coordinates of point B:
Since AB is parallel to the x-axis, $y_B = y_A = -5$.
We need to find $x$ such that $f(x) = -5$:
$$-x^2 + 6x - 5 = -5$$
$$-x^2 + 6x = 0$$
Factor out $x$:
$$x(-x + 6) = 0$$
This gives two solutions for $x$:
$$x_1 = 0 \quad \text{(This corresponds to point A)}$$
$$x_2 = 6 \quad \text{(This corresponds to point B)}$$
The coordinates of point B are $(6, -5)$.

(Self-Check using symmetry: The midpoint of the x-coordinates of A and B should be the axis of symmetry: $\frac{0 + 6}{2} = 3$. This matches the result from (b).)

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) The coordinates of point A are $(0, -5)$.
(b) The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 3$.
(c) The coordinates of point B are $(6, -5)$.
(d) The coordinates of the maximum point P are $(3, 4)$.

(a) Coordinates of point A: (0, -5)

Chapter 1_Q3.png,20 cm,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves calculating areas and perimeters of basic geometric shapes (a triangle and a square) and setting up an algebraic equation based on the relationship between their areas to solve for an unknown variable ($y$). Finally, the perimeter of each shape is calculated using the derived value of $y$, and the difference between these perimeters is found. The core principles are the formulas for the area and perimeter of a triangle and a square, and solving a resulting linear equation.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
Diagram 1: Isosceles Triangle
Base ($b$): $4y$ cm
Height ($h$): $(y + 5)$ cm
Area of Triangle ($A_T$): $\frac{1}{2} b h$

Diagram 2: Square
Side length ($s$): $y$ cm
Area of Square ($A_S$): $s^2$
Perimeter of Square ($P_S$): $4s$

Relationship given: The area of the triangle is $39 \text{ cm}^2$ more than the area of the square.
$A_T = A_S + 39$

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to first find the value of $y$ using the area relationship, and then calculate the difference in perimeter between the triangle ($P_T$) and the square ($P_S$), specifically $|P_T - P_S|$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
1. Area of Triangle ($A_T$):
$A_T = \frac{1}{2} (4y)(y + 5)$
$A_T = 2y(y + 5)$
$A_T = 2y^2 + 10y$

2. Area of Square ($A_S$):
$A_S = y^2$

3. Area Relationship Equation:
$A_T = A_S + 39$
$2y^2 + 10y = y^2 + 39$

4. Perimeter of Square ($P_S$):
$P_S = 4y$

5. Perimeter of Triangle ($P_T$):
Since it is an isosceles triangle, the two non-base sides (let's call the length $L$) are equal. The height bisects the base, creating two right-angled triangles with legs $h = (y+5)$ and $\frac{b}{2} = \frac{4y}{2} = 2y$.
Using the Pythagorean theorem to find $L$:
$L^2 = h^2 + (2y)^2$
$L^2 = (y+5)^2 + (2y)^2$
$L = \sqrt{(y+5)^2 + 4y^2}$
$P_T = \text{Base} + 2L$
$P_T = 4y + 2\sqrt{(y+5)^2 + 4y^2}$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part 1: Solve for $y$ using the area equation.
$2y^2 + 10y = y^2 + 39$
Subtract $y^2$ and $39$ from both sides to form a standard quadratic equation:
$(2y^2 - y^2) + 10y - 39 = 0$
$y^2 + 10y - 39 = 0$

Factor the quadratic equation. We need two numbers that multiply to $-39$ and add up to $10$. These numbers are $13$ and $-3$.
$(y + 13)(y - 3) = 0$

This gives two potential solutions for $y$:
$y = -13$ or $y = 3$

Since $y$ represents a length (side of the square), $y$ must be positive.
Therefore, $y = 3$ cm.

Part 2: Calculate the Perimeters using $y=3$.

A) Perimeter of the Square ($P_S$):
$P_S = 4y$
$P_S = 4(3)$
$P_S = 12$ cm.

B) Perimeter of the Triangle ($P_T$):
We need the length of the equal sides, $L$.
Base $b = 4y = 4(3) = 12$ cm.
Height $h = y + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8$ cm.
The legs of the right triangle are $2y = 2(3) = 6$ cm and $h = 8$ cm.
$L^2 = (6)^2 + (8)^2$
$L^2 = 36 + 64$
$L^2 = 100$
$L = \sqrt{100} = 10$ cm.
$P_T = \text{Base} + 2L$
$P_T = 12 + 2(10)$
$P_T = 12 + 20$
$P_T = 32$ cm.

Part 3: Calculate the difference in perimeter.
Difference $= P_T - P_S$
Difference $= 32 - 12$
Difference $= 20$ cm.

(Self-Check on Areas:
$A_S = y^2 = 3^2 = 9 \text{ cm}^2$.
$A_T = \frac{1}{2}(12)(8) = 48 \text{ cm}^2$.
$A_T - A_S = 48 - 9 = 39 \text{ cm}^2$. This matches the given condition.)

Step 5: Final Answer
The difference in perimeter between both shapes is 20 cm.

The general mathematical concept involved is Number Base Conversion and Identification. Specifically, the problem requires determining if the given numbers, which are implicitly assumed to be in base 10 (decimal system) unless specified otherwise, are valid representations in various lower bases (Base 5, Base 7, Base 8, Base 9). A number is valid in a base $b$ if and only if all its digits are strictly less than the base $b$.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction

The diagram presents four numbers in a sequence: 234, 673, 336, and 281.
We assume these numbers are written in Base 10:
$N_1 = 234_{10}$
$N_2 = 673_{10}$
$N_3 = 336_{10}$
$N_4 = 281_{10}$

The question asks to identify which of these numbers are valid representations when interpreted as being written in the following bases:
(a) Base five ($b=5$)
(b) Base seven ($b=7$)
(c) Base eight ($b=8$)
(d) Base nine ($b=9$)

A number represented by digits $d_k d_{k-1} \dots d_1 d_0$ is valid in base $b$ if and only if $d_i < b$ for all digits $d_i$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation

The goal is to check each of the four base-10 numbers (234, 673, 336, 281) against the digit constraints imposed by Base 5, Base 7, Base 8, and Base 9, and then list the numbers that satisfy the criteria for each specified base.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

For a number $N$ with digits $\{d_i\}$:
(a) Validity in Base 5: All digits $d_i$ must satisfy $d_i < 5$.
(b) Validity in Base 7: All digits $d_i$ must satisfy $d_i < 7$.
(c) Validity in Base 8: All digits $d_i$ must satisfy $d_i < 8$.
(d) Validity in Base 9: All digits $d_i$ must satisfy $d_i < 9$.

Digits of 234: {2, 3, 4}
Digits of 673: {6, 7, 3}
Digits of 336: {3, 3, 6}

The problem involves calculating an average (division) where the input total is given in a non-decimal base (base five), and the divisor (number of days) is known from general knowledge (number of days in January), requiring the result to be expressed in the same non-decimal base (base five). The core mathematical principles are base conversion and arithmetic operations (division) within that specific base system.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The image provides the following key information:
1. Total number of visitors ($T$) in base five: $T = 20202_5$.
2. The time period is January.
3. The zoo opens every day in January.
4. The required answer must be in base five.

From general knowledge (not explicitly in the diagram but required to solve the problem contextually):
The number of days in January ($D$) in base ten is 31.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to find the average number of visitors per day ($\bar{V}$).
The average is calculated as: $\bar{V} = \frac{\text{Total Visitors}}{\text{Number of Days}}$.
We must perform the calculation using base five representations and provide the final answer in base five.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
The required calculation is:
$$\bar{V}_5 = T_5 \div D_{10} \text{ (resulting in base 5)}$$
Where $T_5 = 20202_5$ and $D_{10} = 31_{10}$.

To perform the division in base five, both operands must ideally be converted to base five, or the division must be performed after converting the total to base ten and then converting the result back to base five. Since division is complex in non-standard bases without extensive multiplication tables, converting to base ten, dividing, and converting back is the standard procedure.

Step 3a: Convert Total Visitors ($T$) from base five to base ten.
$$T_{10} = 2 \cdot 5^4 + 0 \cdot 5^3 + 2 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5^1 + 2 \cdot 5^0$$

Step 3b: Convert Number of Days ($D$) from base ten to base five.
$$D_{10} = 31_{10}$$
We need to find $D_5$ such that $D_5 = a_n 5^n + \dots + a_0 5^0$.

Step 3c: Calculate the Average in base ten.
$$\bar{V}_{10} = T_{10} \div D_{10}$$

Step 3d: Convert the result $\bar{V}_{10}$ back to base five.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Step 4a: Convert $T_5 = 20202_5$ to base ten.
$$T_{10} = 2(625) + 0(125) + 2(25) + 0(5) + 2(1)$$
$$T_{10} = 1250 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 2$$
$$T_{10} = 1302_{10}$$

Step 4b: Convert $D_{10} = 31_{10}$ to base five.
Divide 31 repeatedly by 5:
$31 \div 5 = 6$ remainder $1$
$6 \div 5 = 1$ remainder $1$
$1 \div 5 = 0$ remainder $1$
Reading the remainders from bottom to top:
$$D_5 = 111_5$$
Check: $1(5^2) + 1(5^1) + 1(5^0) = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31_{10}$. This is correct.

Step 4c: Calculate the Average in base ten.
$$\bar{V}_{10} = T_{10} \div D_{10} = 1302 \div 31$$

Performing the division:
$1302 \div 31$
$31 \times 40 = 1240$
$1302 - 1240 = 62$
$31 \times 2 = 62$
$62 - 62 = 0$
Thus, $1302 \div 31 = 42$.
$$\bar{V}_{10} = 42_{10}$$

Step 4d: Convert the result $\bar{V}_{10} = 42_{10}$ back to base five.
Divide 42 repeatedly by 5:
$42 \div 5 = 8$ remainder $2$
$8 \div 5 = 1$ remainder $3$
$1 \div 5 = 0$ remainder $1$
Reading the remainders from bottom to top:
$$\bar{V}_5 = 132_5$$

Verification (Optional: Converting $132_5$ to base 10):
$$1(5^2) + 3(5^1) + 2(5^0) = 1(25) + 3(5) + 2(1) = 25 + 15 + 2 = 42_{10}.$$
This matches the base ten average calculation.

The average number of visitors to Zoo Negara each day in January, expressed in base five, is $132_5$.

3.  Interpreting numbers written with subscripts, specifically $3300_4$, which represents a number in base 4 converted to base 10.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram shows a large rectangular playground divided into two sections by a diagonal line:
1.  The shaded section (Children's Playground).
2.  The unshaded section (Adult Exercise Area).
The dimensions of the rectangle are given:
*   Length ($L$): $80 \text{ m}$ (top side, which must be equal to the bottom side).
*   Width ($W$): $x \text{ m}$ (right side, which must be equal to the left side).

The perimeter ($P$) is given as $3300_4$ metres.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to calculate the area of the children's playground (the shaded section). To do this, we first need to determine the unknown dimension $x$ using the given perimeter constraint.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

3.1 Convert the Perimeter from Base 4 to Base 10:
The given perimeter is $P = 3300_4$ metres.
Conversion formula: $d_n d_{n-1} \dots d_0)_b = d_n b^n + d_{n-1} b^{n-1} + \dots + d_0 b^0$.
$$P_{10} = (3 \times 4^3) + (3 \times 4^2) + (0 \times 4^1) + (0 \times 4^0)$$

3.2 Formulate the Perimeter Equation:
For a rectangle with length $L=80$ and width $W=x$:
$$P = 2L + 2W$$
$$P = 2(80) + 2(x)$$

3.3 Formulate the Area Equation for the Children's Playground:
The shaded section (children's playground) is a right-angled triangle formed by the diagonal. The legs of this triangle are the length and width of the rectangle.
Area of a triangle ($A_T$) = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.
$$A_{\text{Children}} = \frac{1}{2} L W = \frac{1}{2} (80)(x)$$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

4.1 Calculate the Perimeter in Base 10:
$$P_{10} = (3 \times 64) + (3 \times 16) + 0 + 0$$
$$P_{10} = 192 + 48$$
$$P_{10} = 240 \text{ metres}$$

4.2 Solve for $x$ using the Perimeter:
We set the base 10 perimeter equal to the perimeter formula:
$$240 = 2(80) + 2x$$
$$240 = 160 + 2x$$
Subtract 160 from both sides:
$$240 - 160 = 2x$$
$$80 = 2x$$
Divide by 2:
$$x = 40 \text{ metres}$$

4.3 Calculate the Area of the Children's Playground:
Using the formula derived in Step 3.3, with $L=80$ m and $x=40$ m:
$$A_{\text{Children}} = \frac{1}{2} (80)(40)$$
$$A_{\text{Children}} = 40 \times 40$$
$$A_{\text{Children}} = 1600$$

The area is $1600$ square metres.

Step 5: Final Answer
The area of the children's playground is 1600 square metres.

The problem involves modeling population growth characterized by a constant rate of doubling over discrete time intervals (days). This situation is fundamentally governed by the principle of Exponential Growth, specifically modeled by an exponential function of the form $P(t) = a \cdot b^t$.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The text provides the explicit mathematical model for the number of new cells produced: $P(t) = 2^t$, where $t$ is the number of days.
The diagram shows a binary tree structure, visually representing the doubling process described: Cell A splits into two, and subsequently, each resulting cell splits into two, illustrating growth by a factor of 2 per step (day).
Key information extracted:
1. The function describing the number of *new* cells produced on day $t$ is $P(t) = 2^t$.
2. $t$ represents the number of days.
3. The initial condition seems to imply $t=1$ corresponds to the first day when new cells are produced. (Cell A is the starting point, and on day 1, two new cells are produced. If $P(t)$ represents the *new* cells produced *on* day $t$, then $P(1) = 2^1 = 2$, which matches the description: ""On the first day, two new cells are produced."")

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The problem asks for two specific calculations based on the exponential growth model $P(t) = 2^t$:
(a) Find the number of new cells produced when the number of days, $t$, is 8. (Calculate $P(8)$).
(b) Find the day, $t$, when the number of new cells produced, $P(t)$, equals 2048. (Solve $P(t) = 2048$ for $t$).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
For part (a): We need to evaluate the function $P(t)$ at $t=8$.
$$P(8) = 2^8$$

For part (b): We need to solve the exponential equation for $t$.
$$2^t = 2048$$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): How many new cells will be produced on the 8th day?
We calculate $P(8)$:
$P(8) = 2^8$
$2^1 = 2$
$2^2 = 4$
$2^3 = 8$
$2^4 = 16$
$2^5 = 32$
$2^6 = 64$
$2^7 = 128$
$2^8 = 256$
Therefore, $P(8) = 256$.

Part (b): On which day will the number of new cells become 2048?
We solve $2^t = 2048$.
We need to express 2048 as a power of 2. We continue the calculation from Part (a):
$2^8 = 256$
$2^9 = 256 \times 2 = 512$
$2^{10} = 512 \times 2 = 1024$
$2^{11} = 1024 \times 2 = 2048$
Thus, $2^t = 2^{11}$, which implies $t = 11$.

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) The number of new cells produced on the 8th day is 256.
(b) The day on which the number of new cells becomes 2048 is the 11th day.

The problem involves the study of sequences and series, specifically geometric progression, applied to the geometric properties of circles (semicircles). The core mathematical principle is determining the general term of a sequence based on observable initial terms, which often involves identifying a common ratio or common difference. Here, since the structure suggests a scaling pattern (likely related to the golden ratio or similar proportional division, though the provided formula suggests a power of 2 reduction), we are dealing with geometric sequences derived from the perimeters of nested geometric figures.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram shows four nested semicircles, each inscribed relative to the previous one, suggesting a self-similar or recursively defined structure.
Key Information Provided:
1. There are four semicircles shown, indexed by $n=0, 1, 2, 3$ (based on the generalization given in part (b)).
2. The largest semicircle (let this be the $n=0$ case) has a radius $R_0 = 32$ cm.

Relationship between Semicircles:
In this common geometric arrangement (often related to the Golden Spiral/Fibonacci construction, though the required formula suggests a simpler progression):
The diameter of a smaller semicircle is equal to the radius of the next larger semicircle it fits into, or it is related by a consistent geometric factor.

Let $R_n$ be the radius of the $n$-th semicircle, where $n=0$ is the largest.
Semicircle 0 (Largest, Green): Radius $R_0 = 32$.
The second largest semicircle (Yellow) appears to have its diameter equal to the radius of the largest one, $R_0$.
If the diameter of Semicircle 1 ($D_1$) equals $R_0$:
$D_1 = R_0 = 32$
Radius $R_1 = D_1 / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.

The third semicircle (Pink/Red outline) fits inside the second. Its diameter ($D_2$) appears to be the radius of the second semicircle, $R_1$.
$D_2 = R_1 = 16$
Radius $R_2 = D_2 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8$.

The fourth semicircle (Blue) fits inside the third. Its diameter ($D_3$) appears to be the radius of the third semicircle, $R_2$.
$D_3 = R_2 = 8$
Radius $R_3 = D_3 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4$.

The radii form a geometric sequence: $R_n = 32, 16, 8, 4, \dots$
This sequence is defined by $R_n = 32 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 2^5 \cdot 2^{-n} = 2^{5-n}$.

Perimeter of a Semicircle:
The perimeter $P$ of a semicircle with radius $R$ consists of the arc length ($\pi R$) and the diameter ($2R$).
$P = \pi R + 2R = R(\pi + 2)$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The problem asks for three things:
(a) Calculate and list the perimeters ($P_n$) for the first four semicircles ($n=0, 1, 2, 3$) in terms of $\pi$.
(b) Show that the generalization for the perimeter is $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ for $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$, based on the results from (a).
(c) Calculate the perimeter of the 8th semicircle ($P_8$).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
The general radius formula derived from the diagram interpretation is $R_n = 2^{5-n}$.
The general perimeter formula is $P_n = R_n(\pi + 2)$.
Substituting $R_n$:
$P_n = 2^{5-n}(\pi + 2)$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Calculate and list the perimeters for $n=0, 1, 2, 3$.

$n=0$ (Largest Semicircle): $R_0 = 32$.
$P_0 = R_0(\pi + 2) = 32(\pi + 2)$.

$n=1$: $R_1 = 16$.
$P_1 = R_1(\pi + 2) = 16(\pi + 2)$.

$n=2$: $R_2 = 8$.
$P_2 = R_2(\pi + 2) = 8(\pi + 2)$.

$n=3$: $R_3 = 4$.
$P_3 = R_3(\pi + 2) = 4(\pi + 2)$.

The list of perimeters is: $32(\pi + 2), 16(\pi + 2), 8(\pi + 2), 4(\pi + 2)$.

Part (b): Show that the generalization is $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$.

We compare our derived formula from Step 3 with the required generalization:
Derived formula: $P_n = 2^{5-n}(\pi + 2)$.
Required generalization: $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$.

There is a discrepancy of a factor of $2^1$ ($2^{6-n} = 2 \cdot 2^{5-n}$). We must re-evaluate the indexing or the relationship based on the required formula $2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$.

Let's test the required formula $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ against the known values from part (a):

If $n=0$ (Largest):
$P_0 = 2^{6-0}(\pi + 2) = 2^6 (\pi + 2) = 64(\pi + 2)$.
However, we calculated $P_0 = 32(\pi + 2)$ because $R_0 = 32$.

If the required formula $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ is correct, it implies:
$R_n = 2^{6-n}$.
For $n=0$, $R_0 = 2^6 = 64$. This contradicts the given information that $R_{\text{largest}} = 32$.

Let's assume the initial calculation based on the diagram geometry ($R_n = 2^{5-n}$) is correct, and perhaps the index 'n' in the provided generalization starts at a different point or implies a different definition of the largest semicircle.

If $n$ starts at $n=0$ for the largest semicircle ($R_0=32$), the correct general formula derived is:
$P_n = 2^{5-n}(\pi + 2)$.

Let's see if the provided formula $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ fits the list if we shift the index $n$.
If the list is $P_k$ for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$:
$P_1 = 32(\pi+2)$
$P_2 = 16(\pi+2)$
$P_3 = 8(\pi+2)$
$P_4 = 4(\pi+2)$

If we use the required form $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, 4$:
$n=1$: $P_1 = 2^{6-1}(\pi+2) = 2^5(\pi+2) = 32(\pi+2)$. (Matches)
$n=2$: $P_2 = 2^{6-2}(\pi+2) = 2^4(\pi+2) = 16(\pi+2)$. (Matches)
$n=3$: $P_3 = 2^{6-3}(\pi+2) = 2^3(\pi+2) = 8(\pi+2)$. (Matches)
$n=4$: $P_4 = 2^{6-4}(\pi+2) = 2^2(\pi+2) = 4(\pi+2)$. (Matches)

Conclusion for Part (b): The problem specifies that $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$ corresponds to the sequence of perimeters shown in part (a). Since the sequence in (a) starts with $32(\pi+2)$ for $n=0$, the provided generalization $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$ is only valid if the index $n$ provided in the prompt description for the sequence $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$ actually corresponds to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc., semicircles, or if the label for the largest one (radius 32) is meant to be $n=1$ instead of $n=0$.

However, the instructions explicitly state: ""Based on the answer from (a), show that the generalisation... is $2^{6-n}(\pi + 2); n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$."" We must align our results from (a) with this formula, implying the index mapping must satisfy the required identity.

We must assume that $P_0$ in the required formula corresponds to the largest calculated perimeter $P_0 = 32(\pi+2)$ from step (a). This means the index $n$ in the formula $2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$ does not correspond to the index $n$ used to calculate $R_n = 2^{5-n}$.

Let $P_{\text{calc}, k}$ be the perimeter calculated in part (a) for $k=0, 1, 2, 3$.
Let $P_{\text{formula}, n}$ be the perimeter given by the generalization for $n=0, 1, 2, 3$.

We must establish the relationship between $k$ and $n$ such that $P_{\text{calc}, k} = P_{\text{formula}, n}$.
From analysis above, if we define the sequence $P_k$ starting at $k=0$ for the largest:
$P_k = 2^{5-k}(\pi + 2)$.

If the required formula is $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$, then for the match to hold for the first term ($k=0$):
$P_{\text{calc}, 0} = 32(\pi+2)$.
$P_{\text{formula}, n} = 32(\pi+2)$.
$2^{6-n} = 32 = 2^5$.
$6 - n = 5 \implies n = 1$.

This means that the index $n$ used in the generalized formula $2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$ corresponds to the index $k-1$ from the calculation in part (a), if we try to match the first term.

Let's re-read part (b): ""Based on the answer from (a), show that the generalisation for the perimeters of the four semicircles is $2^{6-n}(\pi + 2); n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$.""

If we interpret the phrase ""the first four semicircles"" in (a) as $n=0, 1, 2, 3$, and the formula in (b) must map these four results correctly:

Case 1: $n$ in the formula IS the index $k$ from part (a).
$k=0$: Formula gives $2^6(\pi+2)$. Required is $32(\pi+2)$. (Mismatch)
$k=1$: Formula gives $2^5(\pi+2) = 32(\pi+2)$. Required is $16(\pi+2)$. (Mismatch)

Case 2: The problem intends the sequence shown (Radius 32, 16, 8, 4) to be mapped to the formula indices $n=0, 1, 2, 3$ in a way that proves the formula works, likely implying a slight error in the question's index definition relative to the starting condition ($R=32$).

Given that this is a ""show that"" question, we must assume the provided formula is correct and attempt to force the derivation to match the listed terms (a). Since the formula $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$ generates the sequence $\{64, 32, 16, 8, \dots\}$ for $n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$, and the required sequence based on $R_0=32$ is $\{32, 16, 8, 4, \dots\}$, the intended relationship must be:
$P_{\text{required}, n} = P_{\text{calculated}, n+1}$ OR $P_{\text{required}, n+1} = P_{\text{calculated}, n}$.

If we set the index $n$ in the formula such that it maps to the $n$-th term *after* the largest one (i.e., $n=0$ is the second largest, $R_1=16$):
If $n=0$ corresponds to $R_1=16$:
$P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$.
For $n=0$: $P_0 = 2^6(\pi+2) = 64(\pi+2)$. (Still doesn't match $R_1=16$).

Let's use the derived formula $P_k = 2^{5-k}(\pi+2)$ where $k=0$ is the largest ($R_0=32$). We need to show this equals $2^{6-n}(\pi+2)$ for some mapping between $k$ and $n$.

If we set $n = k + 1$:
$P_k = 2^{5-k}(\pi+2)$.
$2^{6-n}(\pi+2) = 2^{6-(k+1)}(\pi+2) = 2^{5-k}(\pi+2)$.
This is an identity.

Therefore, the generalization $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ holds if $n$ is the index shifted by one compared to the index $k$ used to calculate the initial terms, such that the sequence generated by the formula for $n=1, 2, 3, 4$ matches the perimeters calculated for $k=0, 1, 2, 3$.

If the question implies that $n=0$ in the generalization corresponds to the *largest* semicircle ($R_0=32$), then the generalization given in the question is incorrect by a factor of 2, and should be $2^{5-n}(\pi+2)$.

However, in contest mathematics, when asked to ""show that"" a specific formula holds for indices $n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$, we must demonstrate that applying the formula for these indices yields the sequence calculated in (a). Since $n=0, 1, 2, 3$ generates $\{64, 32, 16, 8\}$, and (a) generated $\{32, 16, 8, 4\}$, the only way to ""show"" the required generalization is to state that it correctly generates the sequence starting from $n=1$ ($32, 16, 8, 4, \dots$) and that the problem implicitly re-indexes the list from (a) such that the largest ($R=32$) corresponds to $n=1$.

Let's proceed by assuming the index shift $n=k+1$ is intended, meaning the $n$-th term of the formula corresponds to the $(n-1)$-th calculated term ($k=n-1$).

Proof by consistency check (assuming $n$ in the formula maps to $n-1$ in the calculation list):
Let $k$ be the index from part (a) ($k=0$ is largest, $R_k = 2^{5-k}$).
Let $n$ be the index in the generalization ($n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$).
We show $P_k = 2^{6-(k+1)}(\pi + 2) = 2^{5-k}(\pi + 2)$.
This matches the calculated perimeter $P_k = R_k(\pi+2) = 2^{5-k}(\pi+2)$.
Thus, the given generalization $2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ is correct for the sequence of perimeters if $n$ starts at $n=1$ for the largest semicircle, or if $n=0$ corresponds to the *second* largest semicircle ($R=16$).

Given the ambiguity, we state the relationship derived:
The radius sequence is $R_k = 32 \cdot (1/2)^k = 2^{5-k}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$ (Largest first).
$P_k = 2^{5-k}(\pi + 2)$.
The required formula is $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$.
To show they match the list $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$:
If we set $n = k + 1$:
$P_{\text{formula}} = 2^{6-(k+1)}(\pi + 2) = 2^{5-k}(\pi + 2) = P_k$.
This confirms the structure of the generalization, provided the index $n$ in the generalization starts at $n=1$ for the largest term, or $n=0$ for the second largest term. For the purpose of showing the formula holds for the *set* of values, we demonstrate the common ratio structure implied: the ratio between consecutive terms is $1/2$.
$P_{n} / P_{n+1} = (2^{6-n}) / (2^{6-(n+1)}) = 2^{6-n - (5-n)} = 2^1 = 2$. (Ratio of consecutive terms is 2 if indexing increases). This confirms a geometric progression with ratio $1/2$.

Part (c): Calculate the perimeter, in cm, of the 8th semicircle.

We must determine which index corresponds to the 8th semicircle. Since part (a) listed 4, and part (b) included $n=4$ in the general description, we assume the indexing in the general formula $P_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$ dictates the sequence order, starting at $n=0$ for the largest (Green) if we are following standard mathematical conventions, despite the calculation mismatch in part (b).

If $n=0$ is the largest (Radius 32):
We need the 8th semicircle, which corresponds to $n=7$ (since the largest is $n=0$).
$P_7 = 2^{6-7}(\pi + 2) = 2^{-1}(\pi + 2) = \frac{1}{2}(\pi + 2)$.
$R_7 = 2^{5-7} = 2^{-2} = 1/4$.
$P_7 = R_7(\pi+2) = \frac{1}{4}(\pi + 2)$. (Mismatch between the two structural derivations)

If we follow the structure required by part (b) such that $P_n$ generates the list $\{32, 16, 8, 4, \dots\}$ starting at $n=1$:
$n=1 \implies P_1 = 32(\pi+2)$ (Largest)
$n=2 \implies P_2 = 16(\pi+2)$
...
The 8th semicircle corresponds to $n=8$.
$P_8 = 2^{6-8}(\pi + 2) = 2^{-2}(\pi + 2) = \frac{1}{4}(\pi + 2)$.

Let's verify this using the radius sequence $R_k = 32 \cdot (1/2)^k$, where $k$ is the position in the sequence (1st, 2nd, 3rd...).
The 8th semicircle corresponds to $k=8$.
$R_8 = 32 \cdot (1/2)^{8-1} = 32 \cdot (1/2)^7 = 2^5 / 2^7 = 2^{-2} = 1/4$.
$P_8 = R_8(\pi + 2) = \frac{1}{4}(\pi + 2)$.

This result is consistent regardless of the index shift ambiguity in part (b), provided we interpret ""8th semicircle"" as the term reached after 7 halvings of the radius starting from $R_0=32$.

Final calculation for (c) uses $R_8 = 1/4$ (where $R_1=32$):
$P_8 = \frac{1}{4}(\pi + 2)$.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) Calculate and list the perimeters of the four semicircles, in terms of $\pi$.
Assuming $R_0 = 32$ (largest, $k=0$):
$R_0 = 32, R_1 = 16, R_2 = 8, R_3 = 4$.
$P_k = R_k(\pi + 2)$.
The perimeters are: $32(\pi + 2), 16(\pi + 2), 8(\pi + 2), 4(\pi + 2)$.

(b) Based on the answer from (a), show that the generalisation for the perimeters of the four semicircles is $2^{6-n}(\pi + 2); n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$.
The calculated perimeters are $P_k = 2^{5-k}(\pi + 2)$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3$.
The generalization is $P'_n = 2^{6-n}(\pi + 2)$.
If we map the sequence such that the largest semicircle ($k=0$) corresponds to $n=1$ in the formula:
For $n = k+1$: $P'_n = 2^{6-(k+1)}(\pi + 2) = 2^{5-k}(\pi + 2) = P_k$.
Thus, the generalization holds if the index $n$ in the formula correctly indexes the sequence starting from $n=1$ for the largest term, confirming the required geometric structure $P_n = 2 P_{n+1}$.

(c) Calculate the perimeter, in cm, of the 8th semicircle.
The radii follow $R_k = 32 \cdot (1/2)^{k-1}$ where $k$ is the term number ($k=1$ is largest).
For the 8th semicircle ($k=8$):
$R_8 = 32 \cdot (1/2)^{8-1} = 32 \cdot (1/2)^7 = 2^5 / 2^7 = 2^{-2} = 1/4$ cm.
The perimeter $P_8 = R_8(\pi + 2)$.
$P_8 = \frac{1}{4}(\pi + 2)$ cm.

Boxed Answer for (c):

Chapter 3_Q3.png,"(a) The pattern of the number of cylinders is 2n +1;
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
(b) 104 720 cm3","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves identifying a mathematical sequence based on visual data (number of objects in containers), finding a general formula for the nth term (pattern construction by induction), and then applying a geometric formula (volume of a cylinder) using the derived term for a specific index. The core mathematical principles are Arithmetic Sequences/Progressions and the Volume of a Cylinder.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram shows the number of cylinders in four sequential boxes:
Box 1 (n=1): Number of cylinders = 3
Box 2 (n=2): Number of cylinders = 5
Box 3 (n=3): Number of cylinders = 7
Box 4 (n=4): Number of cylinders = 9
The sequence of the number of cylinders, N(n), is: 3, 5, 7, 9, ...
This is an Arithmetic Progression (AP) because the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
The common difference, $d = 5 - 3 = 2$.
The first term, $a_1 = 3$.

For part (b), the dimensions of each cylinder are given:
Radius, $r = 14 \text{ cm}$
Height, $h = 10 \text{ cm}$

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The question has two parts:
(a) Construct a conclusion by induction for the pattern of the number of cylinders. (Find the explicit formula for $N(n)$).
(b) Calculate the total volume of cylinders in Box 8 ($n=8$), given $r=14$ cm and $h=10$ cm. This requires finding $N(8)$ first, and then multiplying $N(8)$ by the volume of a single cylinder.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

Part (a): Formula for the number of cylinders, $N(n)$.
For an Arithmetic Progression, the general term $N(n)$ is given by:
$N(n) = a_1 + (n-1)d$

Part (b): Total Volume $V_{total}(n)$
The volume of a single cylinder $V_{cyl}$ is:
$V_{cyl} = \pi r^2 h$
The total volume in Box $n$, $V_{total}(n)$, is:
$V_{total}(n) = N(n) \times V_{cyl}$
We need to calculate $V_{total}(8)$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Constructing the conclusion (Finding $N(n)$)
Using the AP formula with $a_1 = 3$ and $d = 2$:
$N(n) = 3 + (n-1)2$
$N(n) = 3 + 2n - 2$
$N(n) = 2n + 1$

Conclusion by Induction (Verifying the pattern based on the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9...):
Base Case (n=1): $N(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. (Matches Box 1)
Inductive Step (Implicit in constructing the conclusion for an AP): Since the difference is constant (d=2), the formula $N(n) = 2n + 1$ accurately describes the sequence.

Part (b): Calculating the total volume in Box 8.

Step 4.1: Find the number of cylinders in Box 8, $N(8)$.
Using the formula derived in Part (a):
$N(8) = 2(8) + 1$
$N(8) = 16 + 1$
$N(8) = 17$ cylinders.

Step 4.2: Calculate the volume of a single cylinder, $V_{cyl}$.
Given $r = 14$ cm and $h = 10$ cm. (Use $\pi \approx 22/7$ or keep it symbolic until the end, standard practice suggests using $\pi$ unless specified otherwise, but for numerical calculations involving 14, $22/7$ is often expected.)
$V_{cyl} = \pi r^2 h$
$V_{cyl} = \pi (14)^2 (10)$
$V_{cyl} = \pi (196)(10)$
$V_{cyl} = 1960\pi \text{ cm}^3$

If we use $\pi = 22/7$:
$V_{cyl} = \frac{22}{7} \times 196 \times 10$
Since $196 / 7 = 28$:
$V_{cyl} = 22 \times 28 \times 10$
$22 \times 28 = 22 \times (30 - 2) = 660 - 44 = 616$
$V_{cyl} = 616 \times 10$
$V_{cyl} = 6160 \text{ cm}^3$

Step 4.3: Calculate the total volume in Box 8, $V_{total}(8)$.
$V_{total}(8) = N(8) \times V_{cyl}$
$V_{total}(8) = 17 \times 1960\pi$

Calculation using $\pi$:
$17 \times 1960 = 17 \times (2000 - 40)$
$17 \times 2000 = 34000$
$17 \times 40 = 680$
$34000 - 680 = 33320$
$V_{total}(8) = 33320\pi \text{ cm}^3$

Calculation using $\pi = 22/7$:
$V_{total}(8) = 17 \times 6160$
$17 \times 6160 = (10 + 7) \times 6160$
$= 61600 + 7 \times 6160$
$7 \times 6160 = 7 \times (6000 + 160) = 42000 + 1120 = 43120$
$V_{total}(8) = 61600 + 43120$
$V_{total}(8) = 104720 \text{ cm}^3$

In mathematics problems context where $\pi$ is not specified, the exact answer $33320\pi$ is generally preferred unless the context implies a practical measurement requiring approximation. Given the numerical input for radius and height, the numerical approximation using $\pi \approx 22/7$ is often sought in secondary school settings. We provide both.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) Conclusion for the pattern of the number of cylinders $N(n)$:
The number of cylinders in Box $n$ is given by the formula:
$N(n) = 2n + 1$

(b) Total volume of cylinders in Box 8:
Number of cylinders in Box 8, $N(8) = 17$.
Volume of one cylinder, $V_{cyl} = 1960\pi \text{ cm}^3$.
Total Volume, $V_{total}(8) = 33320\pi \text{ cm}^3$.

If $\pi = 22/7$ is used:
$V_{total}(8) = 104720 \text{ cm}^3$.

Chapter 4_Q1.png,x = 3,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The general mathematical concept involved is Set Theory, specifically dealing with the cardinality (number of elements) of sets represented in a Venn diagram, and the relationship between the union of sets and the size of the universal set. The key principle is that the total number of elements in the universal set (which is defined as the union of the three sets J, K, and L) is the sum of the cardinalities of all disjoint regions shown in the Venn diagram.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram shows three intersecting sets: J, K, and L. The numbers provided represent the cardinality of the specific disjoint regions within these sets:
1. Elements only in J: 7
2. Elements in $J \cap K$ but not $L$: 2
3. Elements only in K: $x+2$
4. Elements in $K \cap L$ but not $J$: 3
5. Elements only in L: $x+5$
6. Elements in $J \cap L$ but not $K$: (This region is not explicitly labeled with a number or variable, implying its cardinality is 0, or it is implicitly included in the other labeled regions, but based on standard representation for three sets, we must sum all visible numbers, as there is no region outside $J \cup K \cup L$ indicated or mentioned. The problem states $\xi = J \cup K \cup L$, meaning the sum of all labeled regions within the circles equals $n(\xi)$.)
7. Elements in $J \cap K \cap L$: (This region is also not explicitly labeled with a number or variable. Examining the diagram structure, the regions shown are: $J$ only (7), $J \cap K$ only (2), $K$ only ($x+2$), $K \cap L$ only (3), $L$ only ($x+5$). There are two regions missing based on a full three-set intersection diagram: $J \cap L$ only, and $J \cap K \cap L$. However, in this specific drawing style, it is standard to assume that the numbers placed in the intersections represent the cardinality of that specific intersection region, and that any intersection region not explicitly labeled with a variable or number has a cardinality of zero, unless the diagram structure strongly implies otherwise. Since we have 5 explicit counts for the 7 possible regions, we sum the 5 given counts.)

Given information:
Total cardinality of the universal set, $n(\xi) = 25$.
The universal set is defined as $\xi = J \cup K \cup L$.

The sum of the cardinalities of the disjoint regions shown is:
Sum $= 7 + 2 + (x+2) + 3 + (x+5)$

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to calculate the value of $x$ using the provided cardinality of the universal set, $n(\xi) = 25$, and the expressions for the cardinalities of the disjoint regions within the Venn diagram, based on the principle that $n(\xi) = n(J \cup K \cup L)$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Since $\xi = J \cup K \cup L$, the total number of elements in the universal set is the sum of the elements in all disjoint partitions shown:
$$n(\xi) = (\text{Region } J \text{ only}) + (\text{Region } J \cap K \text{ only}) + (\text{Region } K \text{ only}) + (\text{Region } K \cap L \text{ only}) + (\text{Region } L \text{ only})$$
Substituting the given values:
$$25 = 7 + 2 + (x+2) + 3 + (x+5)$$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Write the equation:
$$25 = 7 + 2 + x + 2 + 3 + x + 5$$

2. Group the constant terms and the variable terms:
Constant terms: $7 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5$
Variable terms: $x + x$

3. Sum the constant terms:
$$7 + 2 = 9$$
$$9 + 2 = 11$$
$$11 + 3 = 14$$
$$14 + 5 = 19$$
Constant sum = 19

4. Sum the variable terms:
$$x + x = 2x$$

5. Rewrite the simplified equation:
$$25 = 19 + 2x$$

6. Isolate the term with $x$ by subtracting 19 from both sides:
$$25 - 19 = 2x$$
$$6 = 2x$$

7. Solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by 2:
$$x = \frac{6}{2}$$
$$x = 3$$

Step 5: Final Answer
The value of $x$ is 3.

Chapter 4_Q2.png,39,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves Set Theory, specifically dealing with cardinalities of sets, unions, intersections, and complements, as represented visually in a Venn diagram. The key principle is relating the cardinality of a set to the sum of the cardinalities of the disjoint regions that compose it, and applying set identity laws (like the complement rule) to solve for unknown variables and ultimately find the cardinality of the universal set.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram shows a universal set $\xi$ partitioned into 8 disjoint regions defined by three sets $P$, $Q$, and $R$. The cardinality (number of elements) in each region is given:
1. $n(P \text{ only}): 3$
2. $n(P \cap Q \text{ only}): 2$
3. $n(Q \text{ only}): 4k$
4. $n(P \cap R \text{ only}): k$
5. $n(P \cap Q \cap R): 1$
6. $n(Q \cap R \text{ only}): 5$
7. $n(R \text{ only}):$ (This region is empty or has 0 elements based on the drawing, as the entire circle R appears covered by the intersection regions shown, except for the outer region $2k$. Wait, let's carefully list the regions explicitly labeled outside the intersections.)

Let's list the cardinalities of the seven regions inside the circles $P \cup Q \cup R$:
$n(P \cap Q^c \cap R^c) = 3$
$n(P \cap Q \cap R^c) = 2$
$n(Q \cap P^c \cap R^c) = 4k$
$n(P \cap R \cap Q^c) = k$
$n(P \cap Q \cap R) = 1$
$n(Q \cap R \cap P^c) = 5$
$n(R \cap P^c \cap Q^c) = 0$ (No number is explicitly placed only in R outside the intersections shown, but looking closely at the diagram, the region outside $P$ and $Q$ but inside $R$ seems to be where the $k$ and $5$ are situated near the bottom. Re-evaluating the structure based on standard Venn diagram conventions where numbers are placed in the specific disjoint region they represent):

Region breakdown:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only in P: 3
    \item Only in Q: $4k$
    \item Only in R: Let $x_R$ be the element count. (The diagram shows $2k$ outside all circles, and the bottom section of R seems to only contain the intersection $R \cap Q^c \cap P^c$. However, the number 5 is in $Q \cap R \cap P^c$ and $k$ is in $P \cap R \cap Q^c$. The region only in $R$ appears empty or 0. Let's assume the region outside $P \cup Q \cup R$ is $2k$.)
    \item $P \cap Q$ only ($R^c$): 2
    \item $P \cap R$ only ($Q^c$): $k$
    \item $Q \cap R$ only ($P^c$): 5
    \item $P \cap Q \cap R$: 1
    \item Outside $P \cup Q \cup R$ (i.e., in $\xi$ but not in $P, Q, R$): $2k$
\end{itemize}
Assuming the region inside $R$ but outside $P$ and $Q$ is zero, the regions inside the union $P \cup Q \cup R$ are: $3, 2, 4k, k, 1, 5$.

The given condition is: $n(Q) = n((P \cup R)')$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to determine the cardinality of the universal set, $n(\xi)$. This requires first finding the value of $k$ using the given equality $n(Q) = n((P \cup R)')$, and then summing the cardinalities of all disjoint regions within $\xi$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
A. Calculate $n(Q)$:
$n(Q)$ is the sum of all regions belonging to circle $Q$:
$n(Q) = n(Q \cap P^c \cap R^c) + n(Q \cap P \cap R^c) + n(Q \cap R \cap P^c) + n(P \cap Q \cap R)$
$n(Q) = 4k + 2 + 5 + 1$
$n(Q) = 4k + 8$

B. Calculate $n((P \cup R)')$:
The complement of $(P \cup R)$, denoted $(P \cup R)'$, is the region inside $\xi$ but outside both $P$ and $R$. Looking at the diagram, this region consists only of the elements that are only in $Q$ or outside all three sets.
$(P \cup R)' = Q \cap P' \cap R' \cup (P \cup R \cup Q)'$
Based on the diagram:
$n((P \cup R)') = n(Q \text{ only}) + n(\text{outside all sets})$
$n((P \cup R)') = 4k + 2k$
$n((P \cup R)') = 6k$

C. Apply the given equality:
$n(Q) = n((P \cup R)')$
$4k + 8 = 6k$

D. Calculate $n(\xi)$:
$n(\xi)$ is the sum of the cardinalities of all 8 disjoint regions:
$n(\xi) = 3 + 2 + 4k + k + 1 + 5 + 0 + 2k$ (Assuming region only in R is 0)
$n(\xi) = (3 + 2 + 1 + 5) + (k + 4k + 2k)$
$n(\xi) = 11 + 7k$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Solve for $k$ using the equality derived in Step 3C:
$4k + 8 = 6k$
Subtract $4k$ from both sides:
$8 = 6k - 4k$
$8 = 2k$
Divide by 2:
$k = 4$

2. Calculate $n(\xi)$ using the formula from Step 3D and the value $k=4$:
$n(\xi) = 11 + 7k$
$n(\xi) = 11 + 7(4)$
$n(\xi) = 11 + 28$
$n(\xi) = 39$

(Self-Check: If $k=4$:
$n(Q) = 4(4) + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24$.
$n((P \cup R)') = 6(4) = 24$. The condition holds.
The regions are: 3, 2, $4k=16$, $k=4$, 1, 5, 0, $2k=8$.
Sum: $3 + 2 + 16 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 8 = 39$.)

The value of the cardinality of the universal set is 39.

The problem involves the analysis of simple graphs. The high-level mathematical concepts required are basic graph theory definitions:

2.  **Number of Vertices ($n(V)$ or $|V|$):** The cardinality (count) of the vertex set.
3.  **Edge Set ($E$):** The set of line segments (connections) between vertices.

The general mathematical concept involved is graph theory, specifically finding optimal paths in a directed, weighted graph. This involves determining the shortest path based on two different cost metrics: monetary cost (economical route) and time duration (shortest time route). A crucial element is the application of an additional, constant cost (transit time) at intermediate nodes (vertices).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram is a directed, weighted graph with four vertices: P (Start), Q (Transit), R (Transit), and S (Destination).
The weights on the edges are dual-valued: (Cost in RM, Travel Time in hours).

Edges (Cost, Time):
P -> R: (RM 130, 1.5 hours)
P -> Q: (RM 50, 1 hour)
P -> S: (RM 200, 3 hours)
Q -> R: (RM 45, 0.8 hours)
Q -> S: (RM 115, 1.4 hours)
R -> S: (RM 65, 1.1 hours)

Key Information:
Start Vertex: P
Destination Vertex: S
Transit Airports: Q and R.
Transit Time at Q or R: 45 minutes.
Conversion: 45 minutes = 45/60 hours = 0.75 hours.

Possible routes from P to S:
1. Direct: P -> S
2. Via Q: P -> Q -> S
3. Via R: P -> R -> S
4. Via Q and R: P -> Q -> R -> S
5. Via R and Q: P -> R -> Q -> S (Check if P->R->Q exists in the graph; it does not seem to have a direct edge, but the transit applies *after* landing at Q or R, not *between* them, unless the flight path explicitly includes P->R->Q). Based on the diagram, we only consider the explicit directed edges shown.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to find two specific routes from P to S:
(i) The most economical route (Minimum Total Cost). The total cost includes flight ticket prices plus transit time costs (though the cost of transit time is not specified, typically ""economical"" refers only to the ticket price unless the problem defines a cost associated with time). Given the context of finding ""economical"" vs ""shortest time,"" we assume ""economical"" relates solely to the sum of ticket prices (RM).
(ii) The route that takes the shortest time (Minimum Total Time). The total time includes flight travel times plus the fixed transit time (0.75 hours) incurred at *every* intermediate airport (Q and/or R) visited.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

3.1 Cost Calculation (Economical Route - Minimum Ticket Price)
We calculate the total ticket cost for all possible paths $P \to S$:
Path 1 (Direct): $C(P \to S)$
Path 2 (Via Q): $C(P \to Q) + C(Q \to S)$
Path 3 (Via R): $C(P \to R) + C(R \to S)$
Path 4 (Via Q and R): $C(P \to Q) + C(Q \to R) + C(R \to S)$. (We must verify if $Q \to R$ edge exists. Yes, it does: RM 45, 0.8 hours).
Path 5 (Via R and Q): $C(P \to R) + C(R \to Q) + C(Q \to S)$. (We must verify if $R \to Q$ edge exists. No direct edge $R \to Q$ exists in the graph).
Therefore, we analyze Paths 1, 2, 3, and 4.

3.2 Time Calculation (Shortest Time Route)
We calculate the total travel time for all possible paths. The total time $T$ is the sum of edge travel times plus the total transit time added at intermediate vertices.
Transit time per intermediate stop = $T_{transit} = 0.75$ hours.
If a path has $k$ intermediate stops, Total Time $= (\sum \text{Edge Times}) + k \times T_{transit}$.

Path 1 (P -> S): $T(P \to S) = T_{PS} + 0 \times T_{transit}$
Path 2 (P -> Q -> S): $T(P \to Q \to S) = T_{PQ} + T_{QS} + 1 \times T_{transit}$ (1 stop at Q)
Path 3 (P -> R -> S): $T(P \to R \to S) = T_{PR} + T_{RS} + 1 \times T_{transit}$ (1 stop at R)
Path 4 (P -> Q -> R -> S): $T(P \to Q \to R \to S) = T_{PQ} + T_{QR} + T_{RS} + 2 \times T_{transit}$ (2 stops at Q and R)
Path 5 (P -> R -> Q -> S): As $R \to Q$ does not exist, this path is invalid based on the given graph structure.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

4.1 Finding the Most Economical Route (Minimum Cost)

Path 1: P -> S
Cost = RM 200

Path 2: P -> Q -> S
Cost = RM 50 (P->Q) + RM 115 (Q->S) = RM 165

Path 3: P -> R -> S
Cost = RM 130 (P->R) + RM 65 (R->S) = RM 195

Path 4: P -> Q -> R -> S
Cost = RM 50 (P->Q) + RM 45 (Q->R) + RM 65 (R->S) = RM 160

Comparing Costs: RM 200, RM 165, RM 195, RM 160.
The minimum cost is RM 160.
This corresponds to Route 4: P -> Q -> R -> S.

4.1 (i) The most economical route is P -> Q -> R -> S.

4.2 Finding the Shortest Time Route (Minimum Total Time)
$T_{transit} = 0.75$ hours.

Path 1: P -> S
Total Time = 3 hours.

Path 2: P -> Q -> S
Flight Times = 1 hour (PQ) + 1.4 hours (QS) = 2.4 hours
Transit Time = 1 * 0.75 hours = 0.75 hours
Total Time = 2.4 + 0.75 = 3.15 hours.

Path 3: P -> R -> S
Flight Times = 1.5 hours (PR) + 1.1 hours (RS) = 2.6 hours
Transit Time = 1 * 0.75 hours = 0.75 hours
Total Time = 2.6 + 0.75 = 3.35 hours.

Path 4: P -> Q -> R -> S
Flight Times = 1 hour (PQ) + 0.8 hours (QR) + 1.1 hours (RS) = 2.9 hours
Transit Time = 2 * 0.75 hours = 1.5 hours
Total Time = 2.9 + 1.5 = 4.4 hours.

Comparing Total Times (in hours): 3.00, 3.15, 3.35, 4.40.
The minimum time is 3.00 hours.
This corresponds to Route 1: P -> S.

4.2 (ii) The route that takes the shortest time is P -> S.

Step 5: Final Answer
(i) The most economical route (minimum ticket price) is P -> Q -> R -> S, with a total cost of RM 160.
(ii) The route that takes the shortest time (minimum total elapsed time including transit) is P -> S, with a total time of 3 hours.

Chapter 5_Q3.png,"Route A > C > D > E because it is a safer route even
though Lani had to cycle 300 m more","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves finding the path of least total distance (or minimum cost) between a starting point (Lani's house, A) and an ending point (School, E) in a network where travel directions and distances are specified. This falls under the mathematical category of finding the shortest path in a weighted, directed graph, often solved using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or by enumeration when the graph is small. Since the graph is small and directed, we will enumerate all possible paths from A to E and calculate their total weights (distances).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram is a directed graph representing roads.
Nodes (Locations): A (House), B, C, D, E (School).
Edges (Roads) and Weights (Distances):
The weights must be standardized, preferably to meters (m). Note that 1.1 km = 1100 m.

Directed Edges and Weights:
1. $A \to C$: $350 \text{ m}$
2. $A \to B$: $400 \text{ m}$
3. $B \to E$: $1.1 \text{ km} = 1100 \text{ m}$ (Municipal road)
4. $C \to D$: $800 \text{ m}$
5. $D \to E$: $650 \text{ m}$

The text also mentions edges $AB$, $AC$, $CD$, and $DE$ are in the housing estates, and $BE$ is a municipal road. This descriptive information confirms the paths but does not introduce new edges or change the weights shown on the diagram. The directionality (indicated by arrows) is crucial for path construction.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to suggest the ""best route"" for Lani to cycle from her house ($A$) to the school ($E$) and justify the choice. In this context, ""best route"" means the shortest path, minimizing the total distance traveled. We need to find the path $A \to \dots \to E$ with the minimum total weight.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
We must identify all possible distinct, directed paths from A to E and sum the weights of the edges along each path.

Possible paths from A to E:
Path 1: Using C
Path 2: Using B

Path 1: $A \to C \to D \to E$
Total Distance $D_1 = \text{Weight}(A, C) + \text{Weight}(C, D) + \text{Weight}(D, E)$

Path 2: $A \to B \to E$
Total Distance $D_2 = \text{Weight}(A, B) + \text{Weight}(B, E)$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
First, ensure all units are in meters:
$AB = 400 \text{ m}$
$AC = 350 \text{ m}$
$CD = 800 \text{ m}$
$DE = 650 \text{ m}$
$BE = 1.1 \text{ km} = 1100 \text{ m}$

Calculate the distance for Path 1 ($A \to C \to D \to E$):
$D_1 = 350 \text{ m} + 800 \text{ m} + 650 \text{ m}$
$D_1 = 1150 \text{ m} + 650 \text{ m}$
$D_1 = 1800 \text{ m}$

Calculate the distance for Path 2 ($A \to B \to E$):
$D_2 = 400 \text{ m} + 1100 \text{ m}$
$D_2 = 1500 \text{ m}$

Comparison:
$D_2 = 1500 \text{ m}$
$D_1 = 1800 \text{ m}$
Since $1500 \text{ m} < 1800 \text{ m}$, Path 2 is the shortest route.

Step 5: Final Answer
The best route Lani can choose to cycle to school is the path that minimizes the total distance traveled.

The possible routes are:
1. Route $A \to C \to D \to E$: Total distance = $350 \text{ m} + 800 \text{ m} + 650 \text{ m} = 1800 \text{ m}$.
2. Route $A \to B \to E$: Total distance = $400 \text{ m} + 1100 \text{ m} = 1500 \text{ m}$.

Justification: The best route is $A \to B \to E$ because it results in the minimum distance of $1500 \text{ m}$ compared to the other available route, $A \to C \to D \to E$, which is $1800 \text{ m}$.

The best route is A $\to$ B $\to$ E.

5 x – 1
(b) x >= 2, y >= 0, y < –x + 6","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves three main mathematical concepts:
1. Finding the system of linear inequalities that define a shaded region on a Cartesian plane (Graphing Linear Inequalities).
2. Transforming a region using a geometric transformation, specifically a reflection in the $y$-axis (Geometric Transformations).
3. Expressing the resulting transformed region using a new system of linear inequalities.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The problem requires analyzing two parts, (a) and (b), sequentially. We must first define the inequalities for region (a), then find the image of region (a) under reflection in the $y$-axis, and finally express the inequalities for the image, which corresponds to region (b) if the transformation is correctly applied, or simply state the inequalities for the image of (a). Since the question asks for the inequalities satisfying the *image* of the shaded region in (a) under reflection in the $y$-axis, we will derive the inequalities for the image of (a). We will use the features of graph (a) to determine its initial inequalities and then apply the transformation rule.

**Analysis of Region (a):**
The shaded region in (a) is bounded by three lines/segments:

1.  **Horizontal Boundary:** A dashed line passing through $y=-1$. Since the shading is below this line, the inequality is $y < -1$.
2.  **Vertical Boundary:** A solid vertical line passing through $x=5$. Since the shading is to the left of this line, the inequality is $x \le 5$.
3.  **Slanted Boundary (L1):** This line passes through points $P_1 = (5, -1)$ (solid boundary) and $P_2 = (5, -5)$ (This point seems to be an extension/label on the line, but the triangle vertices appear to be $(0, -1)$ based on the origin $O$ and the horizontal dashed line, the point $(5, -1)$, and a third point on the slanted line. Let's re-examine the vertices of the shaded region in (a).
    *   Vertex 1: $O$ is the origin $(0, 0)$, but the region boundary seems to start at $(0, -1)$ (the endpoint of the dashed line segment originating from the y-axis at $y=-1$). Let's assume the vertices are $A=(0, -1)$, $B=(5, -1)$, and $C=(5, -5)$.
    *   Boundary $AB$: $y = -1$, dashed line. Shading is below. $\implies y < -1$. (Wait, the shading extends below $y=-1$ only along the diagonal line. The horizontal line segment seems to be $y=-1$ for $0 \le x \le 5$, and the shading is below it, which seems inconsistent with the diagonal line passing through $(5,-5)$ and $O$ or $(0,-1)$. Let's re-interpret the boundaries based on standard conventions for simple triangles.)

Let's identify the boundaries based on the given points: $(0, -1)$ implicitly, $(5, -1)$, and $(5, -5)$.
*   Boundary 1 (Horizontal): $y = -1$ (dashed). Shading is below or includes points like $(5, -5)$. The shading suggests $y \le -1$ or $y < -1$ along this segment, but the region extends downward. If the top vertex is $(5, -1)$ and the region extends downwards, this segment is likely the upper bound. Let's assume the vertices are $A(0, -1)$, $B(5, -1)$, and $C(5, -5)$.
    *   If $A=(0, -1)$, $B=(5, -1)$, $C=(5, -5)$: This forms a right triangle.
        *   $AB$: $y = -1$. Shading is below $AB$, so $y \le -1$.
        *   $BC$: $x = 5$. Shading is to the left of $BC$, so $x \le 5$.
        *   $AC$: Line connecting $(0, -1)$ and $(5, -5)$.
            Slope $m = \frac{-5 - (-1)}{5 - 0} = \frac{-4}{5}$.
            Equation: $y - (-1) = -\frac{4}{5}(x - 0) \implies y = -\frac{4}{5}x - 1$.
            The region is ""above"" or to the ""right"" of this line relative to the origin side. Test point $(1, -2)$: $-2$ vs $-\frac{4}{5}(1) - 1 = -1.8$. Since $-2 < -1.8$, the inequality is $y < -\frac{4}{5}x - 1$, or $5y < -4x - 5$, so $4x + 5y < -5$.

**System for Region (a):**
1. $x \le 5$
2. $y \le -1$ (Assuming the top boundary line $y=-1$ is solid, despite the dashed segment shown originating near O. Given the corner $(5,-1)$ is marked with a solid dot, and the region is closed, we use $\le$ or $\ge$ based on context. The dashed line segment from O suggests the origin side boundary might be strict, but the vertices $(5,-1)$ and $(5,-5)$ are solid points defining the boundary). Let's stick to the boundaries implied by the vertices $(0,-1)$, $(5,-1)$, $(5,-5)$.
3. $4x + 5y \le -5$ (If we test $(2, -2)$: $4(2) + 5(-2) = 8 - 10 = -2$. Since $-2 > -5$, the inequality must be $4x + 5y \ge -5$. Wait, let's recheck the shading location relative to $AC$. The shading is generally towards the bottom right corner $(5, -5)$ and away from the $y$-axis side boundary where $x=0$. Let's test the origin $(0, 0)$: $0 \ge -5$. If $(0, 0)$ were in the region, we'd use $\ge$. Since $(0, 0)$ is clearly outside, the inequality must be $4x + 5y \ge -5$.

Let's re-evaluate the boundaries based on the visual appearance of the shaded region (a), which appears to be a closed region bounded by $x=5$, $y=-1$ (partially), and the diagonal line. The region seems to be defined by:
I. $x \le 5$
II. $y \le -1$ (Restricted by the horizontal line segment from $x=0$ to $x=5$ at $y=-1$).
III. The diagonal line $L_1: 4x + 5y = -5$. Shading is below this line relative to the region interior. Test $(4, -3)$: $4(4) + 5(-3) = 16 - 15 = 1$. $1 > -5$. If $4x+5y > -5$, the region is towards the bottom right. This seems consistent with the shading below $y=-1$ for $x=5$.

However, the problem is about reflection. The reflection of the boundaries is simpler than determining the exact vertices of (a) if the goal is to find the description of the image (b). Let's analyze the transformation first.

**Transformation Rule:** Reflection in the $y$-axis maps a point $(x, y)$ to $(x', y') = (-x, y)$.
If the initial region $R_a$ is defined by a set of inequalities in $x$ and $y$:
$F(x, y) \le C$
The transformed region $R_b$ is defined by replacing $x$ with $-x'$ (since $x = -x'$):
$F(-x', y') \le C$.
If the inequalities for (a) are $I_a(x, y)$, the inequalities for the image $R_{image}$ are $I_a(-x, y)$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to find the system of linear inequalities that describe the region obtained by reflecting the shaded region in graph (a) across the $y$-axis.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
We need the inequalities for Region (a), $R_a$, and then apply the transformation $(x, y) \to (-x, y)$ to find the inequalities for $R_{image}$.

**Deriving Inequalities for (a) (Re-analysis focusing on boundaries relative to the interior):**
The vertices seem to be $V_1=(0, -1)$, $V_2=(5, -1)$, $V_3=(5, -5)$.

1.  **Vertical Boundary ($x=5$):** The region is to the left of $x=5$. Since $(5, -1)$ is a solid point and the boundary appears solid, we use $x \le 5$.
2.  **Horizontal Boundary ($y=-1$):** The region is below or at $y=-1$ in the vertical slice $0 \le x \le 5$. We use $y \le -1$. (The dashed line segment shown from $O$ suggests a strict inequality might apply to the boundary line segment passing through the origin, but the overall shape defined by the points suggests the boundaries $x=5$ and $y=-1$ contain the shape). Since the shaded region is bounded by $x=5$ and $y=-1$ on two sides, we use the solid boundaries indicated by the vertices, hence $x \le 5$ and $y \le -1$ for the corner defined by $(5, -1)$ and $(5, -5)$.
3.  **Slanted Boundary ($L_1$):** Connects $V_1=(0, -1)$ and $V_3=(5, -5)$.
    Slope $m = -4/5$. Equation: $y = -\frac{4}{5}x - 1$, or $4x + 5y = -5$.
    Test point inside the triangle, e.g., $(3, -3)$.
    $4(3) + 5(-3) = 12 - 15 = -3$.
    Since $-3 > -5$, the region is defined by $4x + 5y \ge -5$.

System for $R_a$:
(A1) $x \le 5$
(A2) $y \le -1$
(A3) $4x + 5y \ge -5$

**Applying Reflection in the $y$-axis:**
We replace $x$ with $-x$ in the inequalities defining $R_a$.

(I1) $-x \le 5 \implies x \ge -5$
(I2) $y \le -1$ (Unaffected, as $y$ remains $y$)
(I3) $4(-x) + 5y \ge -5 \implies -4x + 5y \ge -5$

The system of inequalities for the image $R_{image}$ is:
1. $x \ge -5$
2. $y \le -1$
3. $-4x + 5y \ge -5$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation (Verification using Graph (b))

We will verify if the derived inequalities match the region shown in graph (b), as the problem setup implies that (b) *is* the image of (a) under reflection in the $y$-axis, although this is not explicitly stated, it is standard for such paired diagrams.

**Analysis of Region (b):**
Region (b) is bounded by three lines/segments. Key features marked: $(-6, 0)$ on the slanted line, $(-2, 4)$ on the vertical line, and the $y$-axis ($x=0$).

1.  **Vertical Boundary:** Solid line $x = -2$. Shading is to the right. $\implies x \ge -2$.
    *Comparison to derived (I1): $x \ge -5$. This is a discrepancy.*

2.  **Horizontal Boundary:** The shading appears bounded below by the $x$-axis ($y=0$) near the origin side, but bounded above by the diagonal line and the vertical line $x=-2$. The region seems to be defined by the $x$-axis, $x=-2$, and the slanted line. Let's check the vertices of (b): $V'_1=(-6, 0)$, $V'_2=(-2, y_2)$, $V'_3=(-2, 0)$.
    *   $V'_2$: Intersection of $x=-2$ and the slanted line. The point $(-2, 4)$ is explicitly marked on the line $x=-2$. So $V'_2=(-2, 4)$.
    *   Boundary $V'_2 V'_3$: $x = -2$ (solid). Shading is to the right. $\implies x \ge -2$.
    *   Boundary $V'_1 V'_3$: The segment on the $x$-axis, $y=0$. Shading is above or on the axis. $\implies y \ge 0$. (This contradicts the derived (I2): $y \le -1$).
    *   Slanted Boundary ($L'_1$): Connects $(-6, 0)$ and $(-2, 4)$.
        Slope $m' = \frac{4 - 0}{-2 - (-6)} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$.
        Equation: $y - 0 = 1(x - (-6)) \implies y = x + 6$, or $x - y = -6$.
        Test point inside (b), e.g., $(-4, 1)$: $1$ vs $(-4) + 6 = 2$. Since $1 < 2$, the inequality is $y < x + 6$, or $x - y > -6$. The shading appears to be below the line when looking from the $y$-axis side, meaning $y \le x + 6$. Or $x - y \ge -6$ if testing $(0, 2)$ which is outside. Test $(0, 1)$: $1 < 6$, so $y < x+6$. If the region is bounded by $x=-2$ and $y=0$, test $(0, 0.1)$. $0.1 < 6$. If the region is $y < x+6$.

Let's re-examine the region (b) shading. It seems to be bounded by $x=-2$ (right), $y=0$ (bottom), and the line $y=x+6$ (left/top). If the triangle vertices are $(-6, 0), (-2, 4), (-2, 0)$:
1. $x \ge -2$ (Right boundary) - Wait, the shading is clearly to the left of $x=-2$ in the region shown. Let's look closely at the boundary marked $x=-2$. The solid line is $x=-2$. The shading is to the LEFT of this line, because the diagonal line goes towards $x=-6$ on the axis.
    *   If shading is to the left: $x \le -2$.
2. $y \ge 0$ (Bottom boundary, $x$-axis).
3. Slanted line $y=x+6$. Test point $(-4, 1)$: $1$ vs $2$. Shading is below the line: $y \le x+6$, or $x - y \ge -6$.

System for (b) based on visual inspection:
(B1) $x \le -2$
(B2) $y \ge 0$
(B3) $x - y \ge -6$

**Comparing $R_{image}$ derived from $R_a$ vs. $R_b$:**
$R_{image}$ derived from (a):
(I1) $x \ge -5$
(I2) $y \le -1$
(I3) $-4x + 5y \ge -5$

$R_b$ visually:
(B1) $x \le -2$
(B2) $y \ge 0$
(B3) $x - y \ge -6$

Since $R_b$ clearly does not match the result of reflecting $R_a$ (e.g., the $y$ bounds are $y \le -1$ vs $y \ge 0$), the question is simply asking for the inequalities corresponding to the reflection of the region in (a), irrespective of whether (b) represents that result. We must provide the inequalities for the image of (a).

**Recalculating the Reflection Transformation (Step 3 confirmation):**
Region (a) boundaries:
1. $x = 5$ (Solid, left side $\implies x \le 5$)
2. $y = -1$ (Solid, lower side $\implies y \le -1$)
3. $4x + 5y = -5$ (Shading below/right $\implies 4x + 5y \ge -5$)

Transformation $(x, y) \to (-x, y)$:
1. $-x \le 5 \implies x \ge -5$. (Image boundary is $x=-5$, shading to the right)
2. $y \le -1$. (Image boundary is $y=-1$, shading below)
3. $4(-x) + 5y \ge -5 \implies -4x + 5y \ge -5$. (Image boundary is $4x - 5y = 5$, shading determined by the inequality).

The image region, $R_{image}$, is defined by the intersection of the half-planes derived above.

Step 5: Final Answer
The linear inequalities that satisfy the image of the shaded region in (a) under a reflection in the $y$-axis are derived by replacing $x$ with $-x$ in the inequalities defining region (a).

Assuming the inequalities defining region (a) are:
1. $x \le 5$
2. $y \le -1$
3. $4x + 5y \ge -5$

The inequalities for the image region are:
1. $-x \le 5 \implies x \ge -5$
2. $y \le -1$
3. $4(-x) + 5y \ge -5 \implies -4x + 5y \ge -5$

The required system of linear inequalities is:
x >= -5
y <= -1

Chapter 6_Q2.png,"(a) x + y <= 500 (b) x <= 3y or 3y >= x
(c) y >= 200","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The general mathematical concept involved is the representation of a region in the Cartesian plane using a system of linear inequalities. This process involves determining the equation of the boundary lines, determining the appropriate inequality sign ($\le, \ge, <, >$) based on the line style (solid or dashed) and the direction of shading, and combining these individual inequalities into a system.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
We analyze each diagram individually to extract the boundary lines, specific points, and shading characteristics.

Part (a):
1. Boundary Line 1 (Vertical): A dashed vertical line passing through $x=-4$.
2. Boundary Line 2 (Slanted): A solid line passing through the origin $(0, 0)$ and the point $(-4, 2)$.
3. Shading: The shaded region is to the right of the vertical line ($x > -4$) and below the slanted line. The point $(-4, 2)$ is shown as a solid point, suggesting it might be included in the boundary, but the vertical line is dashed, meaning $x=-4$ is excluded. However, looking closely at the shading, it is defined by the area strictly to the right of $x=-4$ and below the line. Given the context of typical textbook problems, we must determine the equations for the two boundaries defining the region.

*   Line 2 (Slanted): Passes through $(0, 0)$ and $(-4, 2)$.
    Slope $m = \frac{2 - 0}{-4 - 0} = \frac{2}{-4} = -\frac{1}{2}$.
    Equation: $y = -\frac{1}{2}x$.
*   Line 1 (Vertical): $x = -4$. Since it is dashed, the inequality is strict ($<$ or $>$).
*   Test Point for Shading: Let's use a test point within the shaded region, for example, $(0, 0)$ is on the boundary, so we choose $(1, 0)$.
    For $x=-4$: The shading is to the right, so $x > -4$. (Since the line is dashed, it is strictly greater).
    For $y = -\frac{1}{2}x$: Test $(1, 0)$. $0$ vs $-\frac{1}{2}(1) = -0.5$. Since $0 > -0.5$, the shading is above the line if we only consider this line. However, the shading is clearly *below* the line $y = -\frac{1}{2}x$ relative to the vertical constraint. Let's re-examine the shaded region relative to the line $y = -\frac{1}{2}x$. If we pick a point like $(-3, 0)$ which is shaded: $0$ vs $-\frac{1}{2}(-3) = 1.5$. Since $0 < 1.5$, the inequality is $y < -\frac{1}{2}x$. Since the line is solid, we use $\le$ or $<$. The line is solid, so we use $\le$ or $\ge$. If we look at the corner point $(-4, 2)$, it is plotted as a solid dot, suggesting the boundary $y = -\frac{1}{2}x$ includes this point, and thus should be $y \le -\frac{1}{2}x$.

Final check for (a):
Inequality 1 (Vertical, dashed): $x > -4$.
Inequality 2 (Slanted, solid): $y \le -\frac{1}{2}x$, which is $2y \le -x$, or $x + 2y \le 0$.

Part (b):
The region is a triangle bounded by two lines intersecting at $(0, 4)$ and two points on the x-axis, $(-2, 0)$ and $(3, 0)$. All boundaries appear to be solid lines, implying non-strict inequalities ($\le$ or $\ge$).

*   Line 1 (Left side): Passes through $(-2, 0)$ and $(0, 4)$.
    Slope $m_1 = \frac{4 - 0}{0 - (-2)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$.
    Y-intercept $b=4$.
    Equation: $y = 2x + 4$.
    Test Point (Shaded): $(0, 1)$. $1$ vs $2(0) + 4 = 4$. Since $1 < 4$, the inequality is $y \le 2x + 4$, or $2x - y \ge -4$.

*   Line 2 (Right side): Passes through $(3, 0)$ and $(0, 4)$.
    Slope $m_2 = \frac{4 - 0}{0 - 3} = -\frac{4}{3}$.
    Y-intercept $b=4$.
    Equation: $y = -\frac{4}{3}x + 4$.
    Test Point (Shaded): $(0, 1)$. $1$ vs $-\frac{4}{3}(0) + 4 = 4$. Since $1 < 4$, the inequality is $y \le -\frac{4}{3}x + 4$, which is $3y \le -4x + 12$, or $4x + 3y \le 12$.

*   Implied Constraint (Bottom): The shading is above the x-axis (or possibly bounded by $y=0$). The shading is clearly above $y=0$ in the immediate vicinity of the origin, but the triangle sits on the x-axis based on the intercepts $(-2, 0)$ and $(3, 0)$. Therefore, the third inequality is $y \ge 0$.

Final check for (b):
Inequalities: $y \ge 0$, $y \le 2x + 4$, and $y \le -\frac{4}{3}x + 4$.

Part (c):
The region is bounded by three lines. All boundaries appear solid, suggesting non-strict inequalities.
Key Points Observed:
1. Y-intercept: The line on the left seems to cross the y-axis at $y=-1$.
2. X-intercepts: One line crosses at $x=1$; the other crosses at $x=3$.
3. Another point on the lower line appears to be $(0, -2)$.

*   Line 1 (Upper Boundary): Passes through $(1, 0)$ and appears to pass through $(0, -1)$.
    Slope $m_1 = \frac{0 - (-1)}{1 - 0} = 1$.
    Y-intercept $b=-1$.
    Equation: $y = x - 1$.
    Test Point (Shaded): $(1, 0)$ is on the line. Let's try $(2, 1)$ which looks shaded. $1$ vs $2 - 1 = 1$. This point is on the line. Let's try $(0, 0)$. $0$ vs $0 - 1 = -1$. Since $0 > -1$, the inequality is $y \ge x - 1$, or $x - y \le 1$.

*   Line 2 (Lower Boundary): Passes through $(3, 0)$ and $(0, -2)$.
    Slope $m_2 = \frac{0 - (-2)}{3 - 0} = \frac{2}{3}$.
    Y-intercept $b=-2$.
    Equation: $y = \frac{2}{3}x - 2$.
    Test Point (Shaded): $(1, 0)$. $0$ vs $\frac{2}{3}(1) - 2 = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{6}{3} = -\frac{4}{3}$. Since $0 > -\frac{4}{3}$, the inequality is $y \ge \frac{2}{3}x - 2$, or $3y \ge 2x - 6$, or $2x - 3y \le 6$.

*   Line 3 (Vertical/Implicit Boundary): The shading seems to extend infinitely downwards and leftwards past the drawn segment, but the vertices shown define the enclosed region. The drawn lines define the boundaries of the shaded region shown. The region appears to be defined only by these two lines (forming an angular wedge pointing down and left, with the shading being *inside* the V-shape), OR it is a triangle where the third side is implied or missing from the drawing style. Given the style in (b), it is likely that these two lines form the boundaries defining the region shown. Let's assume the region is bounded by these two lines forming an unbounded region, where the shading is between them.

If the shading represents the region *between* the two lines:
We have $y \ge x - 1$ (Above Line 1) AND $y \ge \frac{2}{3}x - 2$ (Above Line 2).
However, the shaded region in (c) is clearly bounded by the two lines *and* appears to extend downwards and leftwards in the diagram shown, suggesting the region is *between* the lines where the upper line forms the lower bound and the lower line forms the upper bound in the visible section. This contradicts the test points above.

Let's re-evaluate the shading for (c) based on the visible shaded triangle/wedge:
The shaded area is below the upper line and above the lower line in the visible area around the y-axis, but the overall shape suggests a region bounded by these two lines.
Upper Boundary (Line 1: $y = x - 1$): Shading appears BELOW this line. Test $(0, -2)$: $-2$ vs $0 - 1 = -1$. Since $-2 < -1$, the inequality is $y \le x - 1$, or $x - y \ge 1$.
Lower Boundary (Line 2: $y = \frac{2}{3}x - 2$): Shading appears ABOVE this line. Test $(0, -1)$: $-1$ vs $\frac{2}{3}(0) - 2 = -2$. Since $-1 > -2$, the inequality is $y \ge \frac{2}{3}x - 2$, or $2x - 3y \le 6$.

If this is the intended interpretation (the region *between* the two lines):
Inequalities: $y \le x - 1$ AND $y \ge \frac{2}{3}x - 2$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
The goal is to write the system of inequalities for the shaded region in (a), (b), and (c).

(a) System:
1. $x > -4$ (Vertical dashed line)
2. $x + 2y \le 0$ (Solid line through $(0, 0)$ and $(-4, 2)$, shaded below)

(b) System:
1. $y \ge 0$ (X-axis boundary, implied by intercepts)
2. $2x - y \ge -4$ (Solid line through $(-2, 0)$ and $(0, 4)$, shaded below/inside) $\implies y \le 2x + 4$
3. $4x + 3y \le 12$ (Solid line through $(3, 0)$ and $(0, 4)$, shaded below/inside)

(c) System (Assuming the region shown is bounded by the two lines):
1. $x - y \ge 1$ (Upper line $y=x-1$, shaded below)
2. $2x - 3y \le 6$ (Lower line $y=\frac{2}{3}x - 2$, shaded above)

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation (Simplification/Verification)

(a) Verification:
Line 1: $x = -4$. Dashed $\implies x > -4$ or $x < -4$. Shading is right. $x > -4$.
Line 2: $y = -1/2 x$. Solid $\implies y \le$ or $y \ge$. Point $(-4, 2)$ is included (solid dot). Test $(0, -1)$: $-1$ vs $0$. $-1 < 0$. Shading is below. $y \le -1/2 x$, or $2y \le -x$, or $x + 2y \le 0$.
System (a): $x > -4$ and $x + 2y \le 0$.

(b) Verification:
Line 1 ($y=2x+4$): Test $(0, 1)$ inside. $1 < 4$. $y \le 2x+4$.
Line 2 ($y=-4/3 x+4$): Test $(0, 1)$ inside. $1 < 4$. $y \le -4/3 x+4$.
Base: Triangle rests on $y=0$. Shading is above. $y \ge 0$.
System (b): $y \ge 0$, $y \le 2x + 4$, and $y \le -\frac{4}{3}x + 4$.

(c) Verification:
Line 1 ($y=x-1$): Test $(0, -2)$ below the region. $-2$ vs $-1$. $-2 < -1$. Shading must be $y \ge -2$. Test $(2, 0)$ on the line. Test $(0, 0)$: $0$ vs $-1$. $0 > -1$. If $(0, 0)$ is outside, the shading must be $y \le x-1$. $x-y \ge 1$.
Line 2 ($y=2/3 x - 2$): Test $(0, 0)$: $0$ vs $-2$. $0 > -2$. If $(0, 0)$ is outside, the shading must be $y \ge 2/3 x - 2$. $2x - 3y \le 6$.
System (c): $x - y \ge 1$ and $2x - 3y \le 6$. (This represents the wedge bounded by the two lines, where the lower line acts as the lower boundary and the upper line acts as the upper boundary for the visible shaded region.)

Step 5: Final Answer
The inequalities that satisfy the shaded region in each diagram are:

(a)
$x > -4$
$x + 2y \le 0$

(b)
$y \ge 0$
$y \le 2x + 4$
$y \le -\frac{4}{3}x + 4$ (or equivalently, $4x + 3y \le 12$)

(c)

(b) y > –2x, y >= 2x – 8, y <= – 1/2x","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The general mathematical concept involved is the transformation of a region defined by a system of linear inequalities using a geometric operation, specifically a reflection across the x-axis. A reflection across the x-axis maps a point $(x, y)$ to $(x, -y)$. If a region $R$ is defined by a set of inequalities involving $x$ and $y$, the reflected region $R'$ will be defined by substituting $y$ with $-y$ in the original inequalities.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The problem presents two separate regions, (a) and (b), and asks for the inequalities satisfying the *image* of the shaded region under reflection in the x-axis. We must analyze both region (a) and region (b) separately.

Region (a) Analysis:
The shaded region in (a) appears to be defined by the intersection of four boundaries (although one boundary is implicitly defined by the shading direction relative to the axes).
1. A vertical line segment at $x=3$. The shading is to the left of this line, suggesting $x \leq 3$. The line segment appears solid, suggesting inclusion.
2. A horizontal line segment at $y=-2$. The shading is above this line, suggesting $y \geq -2$. The line appears solid, suggesting inclusion.
3. A diagonal line passing through the origin $O(0, 0)$ and the point $(3, 3)$.
    The slope $m = (3-0)/(3-0) = 1$. The equation of the line is $y = x$, or $x - y = 0$.
    The shading is *above* or to the left of this line in the positive quadrant, suggesting $y \geq x$, or $x - y \leq 0$.
4. The y-axis ($x=0$). The shading is to the right of the y-axis, suggesting $x \geq 0$. (Although the region extends left of the y-axis in the $y=-2$ range, the bounding lines strongly suggest the region is: $0 \leq x \leq 3$ and bounded below by $y=-2$ and above by $y=x$ in the relevant quadrant).

Let's re-examine the vertices of the shaded region in (a):
The vertices seem to be approximately: $(0, 0)$, $(3, 0)$, $(3, -2)$, and an intersection point on the left boundary.
Looking closely at the intersection points given: $(3, 3)$ is on the line $y=x$, and $(3, -2)$ is another corner.
The boundaries appear to be:
L1: $x = 3$ (Solid line segment/boundary).
L2: $y = -2$ (Solid line segment/boundary).
L3: $y = x$ (Solid line, passes through origin and $(3, 3)$).
L4: The left boundary appears to pass through the origin $(0, 0)$ and intersect $y=-2$ at some point, or perhaps $x=0$ is a boundary. Given the overall shape, the region seems to be defined by:
i. $x \leq 3$
ii. $y \geq -2$
iii. $y \leq x$ (Shading is below the line $y=x$ where $x$ is positive, but above it where $x$ is negative. Let's trace the shaded area: it's below $y=x$ for $x>0$, and above $y=x$ for $x<0$ near the origin. This suggests the region is defined by the line segment passing through the origin, and the inequality must be consistent with the shaded area).

If we test the center of the rectangular part, e.g., $(1, -1)$:
Test against $y=x$: $-1 < 1$. So, $y < x$ or $x - y > 0$.
If we test the upper left corner, e.g., $(-1, -1.5)$:
Test against $y=x$: $-1.5 < -1$. So, $y < x$ or $x - y > 0$.
It seems the region is bounded by $y \leq x$ or $x - y \geq 0$. (Wait, the line segment passing through the origin looks like $y=x$, and the shading is *below* this line segment for $x>0$ and *above* it for $x<0$. This configuration strongly suggests the boundaries are: $y \geq -2$, $x \leq 3$, and $y \leq x$ for the upper bound, and $x \geq 0$ for the lower left bound, or perhaps the line $y=x$ is the *upper* bound on the right side and the *lower* bound on the left side of the origin, which is impossible for a single inequality).

Let's assume the region is bounded by the drawn lines:
1. $x=3$ (Boundary). Shading to the left: $x \leq 3$.
2. $y=-2$ (Boundary). Shading above: $y \geq -2$.
3. $y=x$ (Boundary). The shaded region lies below this line for $x>0$ and seems to include the origin area. Let's assume the inequality is $y \leq x$, or $x - y \geq 0$.
4. Left boundary: This boundary seems to be $x=0$ for $y \in [-2, 0]$, or it is defined by a line passing through the origin and another point not explicitly labeled, but the shading covers $x>0$ and $x<0$ near $y=0$. Given the vertices $(0, 0)$ and $(3, -2)$, the lowest edge is $y=-2$. The leftmost point seems to be on the y-axis for $y$ near 0.
If the region is the quadrilateral with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(3, 0)$, $(3, -2)$, and an implicit vertex $(-1, -2)$ or similar... No, the region is shaded below $y=x$ and above $y=-2$, and left of $x=3$. The vertex $(0, 0)$ is clearly included. The region appears to be defined by:
$x \leq 3$
$y \geq -2$
$y \leq x$ (Since the point $(3, -2)$ satisfies $-2 \leq 3$. If we test $(1, 0)$: $0 \leq 1$. If we test $(-1, -1.5)$: $-1.5 \leq -1$. This seems consistent: $y \leq x$).
If we include the $x \geq 0$ boundary implicitly: $x \geq 0$.
Original Inequalities for (a):
I_a1: $x \leq 3$
I_a2: $y \geq -2$
I_a3: $y \leq x$ (or $x - y \geq 0$)
I_a4: $x \geq 0$ (If we assume the region stops at the y-axis near the origin).

However, observing the shape, it is a quadrilateral defined by the lines: $x=3$, $y=-2$, $y=x$, and possibly $x=0$. The vertices are $(0, 0), (3, 0), (3, -2)$ and the intersection of $y=x$ and $y=-2$ is $(-2, -2)$. If the vertices are $(0, 0), (3, 0), (3, -2), (-2, -2)$... this doesn't match the drawing.

Let's rely only on the explicit lines shown that define the boundaries: $x=3$ (dashed/solid boundary), $y=-2$ (solid boundary), and $y=x$ (solid line).
The shaded region is bounded by:
1. $x \leq 3$ (Left of vertical dashed line $x=3$).
2. $y \geq -2$ (Above horizontal solid line $y=-2$).
3. $y \leq x$ (Below diagonal line $y=x$, verified by the point $(3, -2)$ which is in the region).

The original inequalities for Region (a) are assumed to be:
$x \leq 3$
$y \geq -2$
$y \leq x$

Region (b) Analysis:
The shaded region is a triangle with vertices $V_1(0, 0)$, $V_2(2, 4)$, and $V_3(4, 2)$.
We need the equations of the three boundary lines.
L1: Line segment $OV_2$ connecting $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 4)$.
Slope $m_1 = (4-0)/(2-0) = 2$. Equation: $y = 2x$, or $2x - y = 0$.
Test point $(3, 2)$ inside the triangle: $2 < 2(3) = 6$. So, $y < 2x$, or $2x - y > 0$.
Inequality I_b1: $2x - y \geq 0$.

L2: Line segment $OV_3$ connecting $(0, 0)$ and $(4, 2)$.
Slope $m_2 = (2-0)/(4-0) = 1/2$. Equation: $y = \frac{1}{2}x$, or $x - 2y = 0$.
Test point $(3, 2)$ inside the triangle: $2 > \frac{1}{2}(3) = 1.5$. So, $y > \frac{1}{2}x$, or $x - 2y < 0$.
Inequality I_b2: $x - 2y \leq 0$.

L3: Line segment $V_2V_3$ connecting $(2, 4)$ and $(4, 2)$.
Slope $m_3 = (2-4)/(4-2) = -2/2 = -1$.
Using point-slope form with $(2, 4)$: $y - 4 = -1(x - 2) \implies y - 4 = -x + 2 \implies x + y = 6$.
Test point $(3, 2)$ inside the triangle: $3 + 2 = 5 < 6$. So, $x + y < 6$.
Inequality I_b3: $x + y \leq 6$.

The original inequalities for Region (b) are:
$2x - y \geq 0$
$x - 2y \leq 0$
$x + y \leq 6$

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to find the system of linear inequalities that define the image of the shaded region in (a) AND the image of the shaded region in (b) after a reflection across the x-axis.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
A reflection across the x-axis transforms a point $(x, y)$ to $(x', y') = (x, -y)$.
To find the new inequalities in terms of $(x', y')$, we substitute $x = x'$ and $y = -y'$ into the original inequalities. For simplicity in writing the final answer, we will express the resulting inequalities using the standard variables $(x, y)$ representing points in the *reflected* region. Thus, we substitute $y$ with $-y$ in the original system.

Transformation Rule: Original $f(x, y) \geq 0$ becomes New $f(x, -y) \geq 0$.

Region (a) Original Inequalities:
1. $x \leq 3$
2. $y \geq -2$
3. $y \leq x$

Region (b) Original Inequalities:
1. $2x - y \geq 0$
2. $x - 2y \leq 0$
3. $x + y \leq 6$

1. Original: $x \leq 3$. Substitution: $x \leq 3$. (No change, as $x$ is preserved).
2. Original: $y \geq -2$. Substitution: $(-y) \geq -2$. Multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality: $y \leq 2$.
3. Original: $y \leq x$. Substitution: $(-y) \leq x$. Multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality: $y \geq -x$, or $x + y \geq 0$.

The image inequalities for region (a) are:
$x \leq 3$
$y \leq 2$
$x + y \geq 0$

Calculation for Image of Region (b):
1. Original: $2x - y \geq 0$. Substitution: $2x - (-y) \geq 0 \implies 2x + y \geq 0$.
2. Original: $x - 2y \leq 0$. Substitution: $x - 2(-y) \leq 0 \implies x + 2y \leq 0$.
3. Original: $x + y \leq 6$. Substitution: $x + (-y) \leq 6 \implies x - y \leq 6$.

The image inequalities for region (b) are:
$2x + y \geq 0$
$x + 2y \leq 0$
$x - y \leq 6$

The problem involves analyzing a speed-time graph for a moving object. The key mathematical concepts are:
1. The rate of change of speed (acceleration) is represented by the gradient (slope) of the speed-time graph.
2. The distance traveled is represented by the area under the speed-time graph.
3. Describing the motion involves interpreting the meaning of different sections (slopes) of the graph over specific time intervals.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram is a speed-time graph with time (t) on the horizontal axis (in seconds) and speed (v) on the vertical axis (in m/s).
The journey is divided into four segments:
Segment 1 (Acceleration): From t=0 s to t=40 s.
   Start point: (0, 0)
   End point: (40, 15)
Segment 2 (Constant Speed): From t=40 s to t=120 s.
   Speed $v = 15 \text{ m/s}$.
Segment 3 (Deceleration): From t=120 s to t=150 s.
   Start point: (120, 15)
   End point: (150, 0)
The shape formed by the graph and the time axis is a trapezium.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to answer three specific questions based on the graph:
(a) Calculate the acceleration ($a$) during the first 20 seconds ($0 \le t \le 20$). Since the acceleration is constant for $0 \le t \le 40$, this is the gradient of the first segment. The unit required is $\text{m s}^{-2}$.
(b) Calculate the distance traveled during the period of uniform speed. This corresponds to Segment 2 ($40 < t < 120$). Distance is the area under the graph for this interval. The unit required is metres.
(c) Describe the motion for a time period of 2.5 minutes. Since the graph only goes up to $t=150$ seconds, 2.5 minutes must be converted to seconds, and the description must cover this entire converted time span if possible, or state the motion up to the end of the graphed journey if the time exceeds the graph duration.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
(a) Acceleration ($a$) = Gradient of the line segment for $0 \le t \le 40$.
$$a = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$
Using points $(t_1, v_1) = (0, 0)$ and $(t_2, v_2) = (40, 15)$.

(b) Distance ($D_{uniform}$) = Area of the rectangle formed between $t=40$ s and $t=120$ s.
$$D_{uniform} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time duration}$$
$$\text{Time duration} = 120 - 40$$

(c) Time conversion and description:
$$T = 2.5 \text{ minutes}$$
$$T_{seconds} = T \times 60$$
The description needs to cover the physical interpretation of the graph segments corresponding to this time.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(a) Calculate the rate of change of speed (acceleration) for the first 20 seconds.
Since the acceleration is constant from $t=0$ to $t=40$ s:
$$a = \frac{15 \text{ m/s} - 0 \text{ m/s}}{40 \text{ s} - 0 \text{ s}}$$
$$a = \frac{15}{40} \text{ m s}^{-2}$$
$$a = \frac{3}{8} \text{ m s}^{-2}$$
As a decimal:
$$a = 0.375 \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

(b) Calculate the distance traveled at a uniform speed.
The uniform speed is $v = 15 \text{ m/s}$, which occurs between $t=40$ s and $t=120$ s.
Time duration $(\Delta t) = 120 \text{ s} - 40 \text{ s} = 80 \text{ s}$.
Distance $D_{uniform} = v \times \Delta t$
$$D_{uniform} = 15 \text{ m/s} \times 80 \text{ s}$$
$$D_{uniform} = 1200 \text{ metres}$$

(c) Describe Encik Merisat's journey for the period of 2.5 minutes.
First, convert 2.5 minutes to seconds:
$$2.5 \text{ minutes} = 2.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 150 \text{ seconds}$$
The entire journey shown on the graph lasts exactly 150 seconds (from $t=0$ to $t=150$ s).
The description must cover the three distinct phases within these 150 seconds:
1. $t=0$ s to $t=40$ s: The car accelerates uniformly from $0 \text{ m/s}$ to $15 \text{ m/s}$.
2. $t=40$ s to $t=120$ s: The car travels at a constant maximum speed of $15 \text{ m/s}$.
3. $t=120$ s to $t=150$ s: The car decelerates uniformly, coming to a complete stop ($0 \text{ m/s}$) at $t=150$ s.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) The rate of change of speed (acceleration) for the first 20 seconds is:
$$a = 0.375 \text{ m s}^{-2} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{3}{8} \text{ m s}^{-2}$$

(b) The distance traveled at a uniform speed is:
$$D_{uniform} = 1200 \text{ metres}$$

(c) Description of Encik Merisat's journey for 2.5 minutes (150 seconds):
The journey consists of three parts:
1. For the first 40 seconds, the car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of $15 \text{ m/s}$.
2. Between 40 seconds and 120 seconds (a duration of 80 seconds), the car maintains a constant speed of $15 \text{ m/s}$.
3. For the final 30 seconds (from 120 s to 150 s), the car decelerates uniformly, coming to rest at $t=150$ seconds.",wrong,5.489399671554565,4,5,"Total marks = 5.

The general mathematical concept involved is the analysis of motion represented by distance-time graphs. The rate of change in distance with respect to time is the speed (or velocity), which is calculated as the gradient (slope) of the line segment on the distance-time graph. The problem involves interpreting different segments of piecewise linear functions and calculating their gradients.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram is a distance-time graph showing the motion of a Car (magenta line) and a Tour bus (green line).
Key Information given in the text:
Total distance traveled by both vehicles = $150 \text{ km}$.
Total time taken for the journey = $3 \text{ hours}$.

Key Features from the Graph:
1. The axes are Distance (km) on the vertical axis and Time (hours) on the horizontal axis.
2. The Tour bus (Green line, $OR$) starts at the origin $O=(0, 0)$ and ends at $R=(3, 150)$.
3. The Car (Magenta line, $AB$) starts at $A=(0, 150)$ and ends at $B=(3, 0)$.
4. The meeting point of the Car and the Tour bus is $Q$, which occurs at time $t$. Let $Q = (t, d_Q)$, where $d_Q$ is the distance from the starting point (for the bus) or distance remaining (for the car).
5. The graph for the Car seems to have a change in speed at point $P$. The coordinates are $P = (0.7, 70)$.
6. The graph for the Tour bus also seems to have a change in speed at $Q$. The segment $PQ$ is horizontal for the car, which implies the car stopped or maintained a distance of $70 \text{ km}$ from its starting point (or $150-70=80 \text{ km}$ from the destination) for a period. However, examining the graph carefully:
    * The Tour bus path is $O \to Q \to R$.
    * The Car path is $A \to P \to Q \to B$. (This interpretation seems problematic due to the segment $PQ$ being horizontal on the distance axis for the car, which means the distance *from the origin* for the car is constant from $t=0.7$ to $t=t$. Let's re-examine the context).

Re-interpreting the Motion based on the questions:
The question implies both start/end at $150 \text{ km}$ total separation, traveling towards each other or covering the same $150 \text{ km}$ distance in some relation. Given $A=(0, 150)$ and $B=(3, 0)$ for the car, the car is traveling from distance $150 \text{ km}$ down to $0 \text{ km}$ in 3 hours. Given $O=(0, 0)$ and $R=(3, 150)$ for the bus, the bus is traveling from $0 \text{ km}$ up to $150 \text{ km}$ in 3 hours. They are traveling the same $150 \text{ km}$ route in opposite directions, meeting at point $Q$.

Car motion segments: $A \to P$ and $P \to Q$ and $Q \to B$.
Point $P$: Time $t_P = 0.7$ hours, Distance $d_P = 70 \text{ km}$ (from destination, or $150-70=80 \text{ km}$ remaining). Wait, the distance axis must represent the distance traveled by the bus OR the distance remaining for the car. Since the bus starts at 0 and goes to 150, the vertical axis is Distance from the starting point of the bus.
Car: Starts at $150 \text{ km}$ mark (Distance $= 150$) and ends at $0 \text{ km}$ mark (Distance $= 0$).
Point $P = (0.7, 70)$. At $t=0.7$ hours, the car is at a distance of $70 \text{ km}$ from the destination (or $150-70=80 \text{ km}$ traveled).

Tour Bus motion segments: $O \to Q \to R$.
$Q$ is the intersection point. $Q = (t, d_Q)$.

Bus Speed: $v_{bus} = \frac{150 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ h}} = 50 \text{ km/h}$.
The bus moves at a constant speed for the whole journey $OR$.
Equation for the Tour bus: Distance $= 50 \times \text{Time}$.
So, $d_Q = 50t$.

Car Speed (Overall average): $v_{car, avg} = \frac{150 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ h}} = 50 \text{ km/h}$ (in terms of distance covered towards 0).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to calculate three quantities related to the speed (rate of change of distance) of the Car and the time $t$:
(a) The rate of change in distance ($\text{km h}^{-1}$, i.e., speed) of the car for the first 24 minutes. This corresponds to the segment $AP$.
(b) The value of $t$, which is the time when the car and the bus meet at point $Q$.
(c) The rate of change in distance ($\text{km h}^{-1}$) of the car for the last $80 \text{ km}$ traveled (i.e., the segment leading up to point $B=(3, 0)$).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

Part (a): Speed of the car for the first 24 minutes.
This corresponds to the segment $AP$.
$A = (0, 150)$.
$P = (0.7, 70)$.
Time interval in hours: $24 \text{ minutes} = \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.4 \text{ hours}$.
Since $0.4 < 0.7$, the first 24 minutes fall entirely within the segment $AP$.
Speed $v_a = \text{Gradient of } AP = \frac{\text{Change in Distance}}{\text{Change in Time}} = \frac{d_A - d_P}{t_A - t_P}$.

Part (b): Value of $t$.
$t$ is the time coordinate of the intersection point $Q$. At $Q$, the distance covered by the bus equals the distance covered by the car from its start (or, in terms of the graph coordinates, the distance readings must match).
Let $Q = (t, d_Q)$.
Since $Q$ lies on the Tour bus path $OR$: $d_Q = 50t$.
Since $Q$ lies on the Car path, we need the equation for the car's motion after point $P$. If the segment $PQ$ is horizontal for the car (meaning the distance reading $d_Q$ is the same as $d_P=70$), then $P$ and $Q$ have the same vertical coordinate. This implies the car stopped at distance $70 \text{ km}$ from the destination (i.e., traveled $80 \text{ km}$) from $t=0.7$ until $t=t$.

Let's check the graph structure for the car:
Segment 1: $A(0, 150)$ to $P(0.7, 70)$. (Speed $v_{car, 1}$)
Segment 2: $P(0.7, 70)$ to $Q(t, d_Q)$.
Segment 3: $Q(t, d_Q)$ to $B(3, 0)$.

If $P$ and $Q$ share the same distance reading ($d_Q = 70$), then the car traveled $150 - 70 = 80 \text{ km}$ in the first $0.7$ hours. Speed $v_{car, 1} = 80/0.7$.
If $d_Q = 70$, then for the bus: $70 = 50t$, so $t = 70/50 = 1.4$ hours.
This implies $Q=(1.4, 70)$. Since $1.4 > 0.7$, $Q$ occurs after $P$. If $d_Q=d_P=70$, the car stopped between $t=0.7$ and $t=1.4$. The segment $PQ$ would be horizontal, meaning the slope is 0.

Let's verify the interpretation of the segment $PQ$. In standard distance-time graphs where both vehicles are traveling between two points (0 and 150), a horizontal segment for the car means the distance reading (distance from the destination) is constant, meaning the car stopped moving relative to the destination marker. If the bus is moving, the intersection $Q$ must occur where their distances are equal ($d_{bus} = d_{car}$).

If $d_Q = 70$:
For the bus: $70 = 50t \implies t = 1.4$ hours.
If $t=1.4$, then $Q=(1.4, 70)$.
The car path goes from $A(0, 150) \to P(0.7, 70) \to Q(1.4, 70)$.
The segment $PQ$ connects $(0.7, 70)$ to $(1.4, 70)$. The gradient is 0. This means the car's distance from the destination remained $70 \text{ km}$ between $t=0.7$ and $t=1.4$. This is mathematically consistent with the visual representation where the car line appears horizontal between $P$ and $Q$.

Part (c): Speed of the car for the last $80 \text{ km}$.
The car travels $150 \text{ km}$ in total. The last $80 \text{ km}$ corresponds to the distance segment decreasing from $80 \text{ km}$ to $0 \text{ km}$.
If the distance axis represents distance from the destination:
Start of the last $80 \text{ km}$ segment is when Distance $= 80 \text{ km}$ (i.e., $150 - 80 = 70 \text{ km}$ traveled).
End of the last $80 \text{ km}$ segment is when Distance $= 0 \text{ km}$ (i.e., $150 \text{ km}$ traveled, point $B$).
This segment corresponds to the path $PQB$ or $QB$. Since $Q=(1.4, 70)$, the segment $QB$ represents the car traveling the last $70 \text{ km}$ reading (which is $80 \text{ km}$ distance covered).
The calculation should use the endpoints of this final $80 \text{ km}$ travel for the car.
Start point: Distance $= 80 \text{ km}$ remaining. This happens at $P(0.7, 70)$ IF the segment $PQ$ has zero speed.
If $PQ$ has zero speed, then the car starts moving again towards $B$ at $Q=(1.4, 70)$.
The last $80 \text{ km}$ covered is from the point where $70 \text{ km}$ remains (at $t=0.7$ if $PQ$ segment is ignored, or at $t=1.4$ if $PQ$ is a stop).
Let's look at the path $Q \to B$. $Q=(1.4, 70)$, $B=(3, 0)$.
Distance covered in segment $QB$: $70 - 0 = 70 \text{ km}$ (in terms of distance reading decrease). This means $70 \text{ km}$ covered towards the destination.
If the question means the last $80 \text{ km}$ traveled in total distance, we must look at the car traveling from $150-80 = 70 \text{ km}$ remaining to $0 \text{ km}$ remaining. This distance covered is $80 \text{ km}$.
This corresponds to the portion of the graph where the distance reading goes from $70$ down to $0$. Based on the finding $Q=(1.4, 70)$, this final motion is represented by the segment $QB$.
Speed $v_c = \text{Gradient of } QB = \frac{d_Q - d_B}{t_Q - t_B}$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Rate of change for the first 24 minutes ($0.4$ hours). (Segment $AP$)
$A = (0, 150)$, $P = (0.7, 70)$.
$v_a = \frac{150 - 70}{0 - 0.7} = \frac{80}{-0.7} = -\frac{80}{7/10} = -\frac{800}{7} \text{ km/h}$.
The rate of change (speed) is the magnitude of this, but typically, rate of change in distance (as plotted) is negative since the distance from $A$ is decreasing. However, speed is usually positive. Given the context of calculating rates of change, we should provide the slope, which is negative, or state the speed as positive. Since the units are $\text{km h}^{-1}$ and it asks for the *rate of change in distance*, we state the slope. If it asked for speed, we'd take the absolute value. Let's provide the numerical value of the slope.
$v_a = -\frac{800}{7} \text{ km/h}$.
If the question implicitly means speed (which is common in these contexts, especially when comparing to other positive speeds): Speed $= |v_a| = \frac{800}{7} \text{ km/h}$.
Let's calculate the approximate speed: $800 / 7 \approx 114.286 \text{ km/h}$.

Part (b): Value of $t$.
We established that for the meeting point $Q=(t, d_Q)$, $d_Q$ must be the same for both vehicles, and based on the visual structure $P=(0.7, 70)$ suggesting the car stopped until $Q$, we hypothesize $d_Q = d_P = 70 \text{ km}$.
For the Tour bus ($O \to R$): $v_{bus} = 50 \text{ km/h}$.
$d_Q = v_{bus} \times t$
$70 = 50t$
$t = \frac{70}{50} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4$ hours.

We must check if this point $Q=(1.4, 70)$ is consistent with the car's subsequent motion $Q \to B(3, 0)$.
Car speed segment $QB$: $v_{c, 2} = \frac{70 - 0}{1.4 - 3} = \frac{70}{-1.6} = \frac{70}{-16/10} = -\frac{700}{16} = -\frac{175}{4} = -43.75 \text{ km/h}$.
This is a valid, constant speed for the final segment of the car's journey.

Part (c): Rate of change for the last $80 \text{ km}$ of the car.
The car travels $150 \text{ km}$ total. The last $80 \text{ km}$ is covered when the distance reading decreases from $70 \text{ km}$ remaining to $0 \text{ km}$ remaining.
This motion is represented by the segment $QB$, since $Q=(1.4, 70)$ and $B=(3, 0)$.
The rate of change is the gradient of $QB$.
$v_c = \frac{d_Q - d_B}{t_Q - t_B} = \frac{70 - 0}{1.4 - 3} = -\frac{70}{1.6} = -43.75 \text{ km/h}$.

If the question asks for the rate of change in distance (the slope), the answer is $-43.75$. If it asks for speed, it is $43.75$. We stick to the calculated slope as the rate of change.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) The rate of change in distance, in $\text{km h}^{-1}$, of the car for the first 24 minutes ($0.4$ hours):
Rate of change $= \frac{150 - 70}{0 - 0.7} = \frac{80}{-0.7} = -\frac{800}{7} \text{ km h}^{-1}$.
(If speed is required, $\frac{800}{7} \text{ km h}^{-1} \approx 114.3 \text{ km h}^{-1}$)

(b) The value of $t$:
$t = 1.4$ hours.

(c) The rate of change in distance, in $\text{km h}^{-1}$, of the car for the last $80 \text{ km}$: (Segment $QB$)
Rate of change $= \frac{70 - 0}{1.4 - 3} = \frac{70}{-1.6} = -43.75 \text{ km h}^{-1}$.

Final Answer Summary:
(a) $-\frac{800}{7} \text{ km h}^{-1}$ (or $\approx -114.3 \text{ km h}^{-1}$)
(b) $1.4$
(c) $-43.75 \text{ km h}^{-1}$

Since problems of this nature usually imply speed when asking for rates of change related to specific distances traveled, and the negative sign only indicates direction relative to the axis definition, providing the magnitude (speed) might be expected for (a) and (c). We provide the mathematically derived gradient for completeness as the rate of change.

Chapter 7_Q3.png,(a) 8 seconds (b) 17,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves analyzing motion described by a speed-time graph. The fundamental mathematical principle relating speed-time graphs and distance traveled is that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the speed-time graph. The motion of the vehicles involves segments of constant speed (zero acceleration) and constant acceleration (straight lines with non-zero slope).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram is a speed-time graph for a Car (magenta line, O to R) and a Motorcycle (green line, O to P to Q to R). Time ($T$) is on the horizontal axis (seconds), and Speed ($V$) is on the vertical axis ($\text{m s}^{-1}$).

Key features extracted:
1.  **Car's motion (Magenta line OR):** Starts at $(0, 0)$ and ends at $(t, 10)$. This suggests constant acceleration for the entire duration $t$.
2.  **Motorcycle's motion (Green line OPQR):**
    *   Segment OP: From $T=0$ to $T=2$ seconds, the speed increases from $V=0$ to $V=4 \text{ m s}^{-1}$. (Constant acceleration)
    *   Segment PQ: From $T=2$ to $T=10$ seconds, the speed is constant at $V=4 \text{ m s}^{-1}$. (Uniform speed)
    *   Segment QR: From $T=10$ seconds to $T=t$ seconds, the speed increases from $V=4 \text{ m s}^{-1}$ to $V=10 \text{ m s}^{-1}$ at time $t$. (Constant acceleration)

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The problem asks for two calculations:
(a) The duration when the motorcycle travels at a uniform speed. This requires finding the time interval corresponding to the horizontal segment PQ of the motorcycle's graph.
(b) The value of $t$ such that the total distance traveled by the car equals the total distance traveled by the motorcycle over the period of $t$ seconds. This requires equating the areas under both graphs up to time $t$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

Part (a): Duration of uniform speed for the motorcycle.
Uniform speed occurs during the segment PQ, where $V=4 \text{ m s}^{-1}$.
Start time for uniform speed $= 2$ seconds.
End time for uniform speed $= 10$ seconds.
Duration $= (\text{End time}) - (\text{Start time})$.

Part (b): Value of $t$ where $D_{\text{Car}}(t) = D_{\text{Motorcycle}}(t)$.
Distance = Area under the graph.

Car's Distance $D_C(t)$: The area under the line segment OR up to time $t$. This forms a triangle with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(t, 0)$, and $(t, 10)$.
$D_C(t) = \text{Area of Triangle OR}'$ (where $R'$ is the projection of R onto the time axis) $= \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \times t \times 10 = 5t$.
*Alternatively, the acceleration $a_C = \frac{10}{t}$. $D_C(t) = \frac{1}{2} a_C t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{10}{t}\right) t^2 = 5t$.*

Motorcycle's Distance $D_M(t)$: The area under the graph OPQR up to time $t$. Since the condition is set for the period up to $t$, and R is at time $t$, we calculate the total area under OPQR up to time $t$. This area is composed of three shapes:
1. Triangle OP (from $T=0$ to $T=2$)
2. Rectangle PQ (from $T=2$ to $T=10$)
3. Triangle QR (from $T=10$ to $T=t$)

$D_M(t) = \text{Area(OP)} + \text{Area(PQ)} + \text{Area(QR)}$

Area(OP) (Triangle): Base $= 2$, Height $= 4$.
Area(OP) $= \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4$.

Area(PQ) (Rectangle): Width $= 10 - 2 = 8$, Height $= 4$.
Area(PQ) $= 8 \times 4 = 32$.

Area(QR) (Trapezoid/Triangle): This segment is part of the motorcycle's motion from $T=10$ to $T=t$. We need the acceleration of the motorcycle in this segment, $a_M$.
First, find the equation of the line segment QR. It passes through $(10, 4)$ and $(t, 10)$.
Acceleration $a_M = \frac{10 - 4}{t - 10} = \frac{6}{t - 10}$.
The area under QR is a trapezoid defined by vertices $(10, 0)$, $(t, 0)$, $(t, 10)$, and $(10, 4)$.
Area(QR) $= \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Sum of parallel sides}) \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (4 + 10) \times (t - 10) = 7(t - 10)$.

Total Distance for Motorcycle:
$D_M(t) = 4 + 32 + 7(t - 10)$
$D_M(t) = 36 + 7t - 70$
$D_M(t) = 7t - 34$.

Equating Distances:
$D_C(t) = D_M(t)$
$5t = 7t - 34$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a) Calculation:
Duration $= 10 \text{ s} - 2 \text{ s} = 8 \text{ seconds}$.

Part (b) Calculation:
Set up the equality:
$5t = 7t - 34$

Solve for $t$:
$34 = 7t - 5t$
$34 = 2t$
$t = \frac{34}{2}$
$t = 17$.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) The duration when the motorcycle travels at a uniform speed is calculated from the time segment where its speed is constant, which is from $t=2$ s to $t=10$ s.
Duration = $10 - 2 = 8$ seconds.

(b) The value of $t$ is found by equating the total distance traveled by the car ($D_C = 5t$) and the motorcycle ($D_M = 7t - 34$) up to time $t$.
$5t = 7t - 34$
$2t = 34$
$t = 17$.

Final Answer for (a): 8 seconds
Final Answer for (b): 17

(a) The duration when the motorcycle travels at a uniform speed is 8 seconds.

(b) interquartile range","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves descriptive statistics for grouped data presented in a frequency distribution table. Specifically, it requires calculating measures of central tendency (implicitly, for variance) and measures of dispersion: Range, Interquartile Range (IQR), Variance ($\sigma^2$), and Standard Deviation ($\sigma$). Additionally, it requires a qualitative assessment of the most appropriate measure of dispersion.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The input is a frequency distribution table for the time taken (in hours) by $N=32$ pupils for revision.

Data Points ($x_i$ = Time in hours, $f_i$ = Number of pupils):
| $x_i$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 10 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| $f_i$ | 2 | 5 | 6 | 9 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

Total number of pupils, $N = \sum f_i = 2+5+6+9+6+2+1+1 = 32$.

To calculate quartiles, variance, and standard deviation, we need the cumulative frequency ($CF$):
| $x_i$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 10 | Total |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|-------|
| $f_i$ | 2 | 5 | 6 | 9 | 6 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 32 |
| $CF$ | 2 | 7 | 13 | 22 | 28 | 30 | 31 | 32 | 32 |

The maximum time is $x_{max} = 10$ hours.
The minimum time is $x_{min} = 1$ hour.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The question asks for four specific statistical calculations (Range, IQR, Variance, Standard Deviation) based on the provided frequency distribution data, and then to identify the most appropriate measure of dispersion among standard options (like Range, IQR, Variance, Standard Deviation) to describe the spread of the revision times.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

a) Calculations:
1. Range (R): $R = x_{max} - x_{min}$
2. Interquartile Range (IQR): $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$. We use the position method for discrete data.
   Position of $Q_1 = (N+1)/4$.
   Position of $Q_3 = 3(N+1)/4$.
3. Mean ($\bar{x}$): $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i f_i}{N}$
4. Variance ($\sigma^2$): $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 f_i}{N}$ (Population variance, standard for descriptive statistics unless otherwise specified, or using the computational formula $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i}{N} - \bar{x}^2$). We will use the standard definition involving the mean.
5. Standard Deviation ($\sigma$): $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$

b) Appropriate Measure of Dispersion:
We must justify the choice based on the nature of the data and the calculations performed.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

a) Calculations:

1. Range (R):
$R = 10 - 1 = 9$ hours.

2. Interquartile Range (IQR): $N=32$.
Position of $Q_1 = (32+1)/4 = 33/4 = 8.25$.
Since the position is 8.25, $Q_1$ lies between the 8th and 9th value.
CF values: CF up to $x=2$ is 7. CF up to $x=3$ is 13.
The 8th and 9th values both correspond to $x=3$.
$Q_1 = 3$ hours. (Using interpolation method or convention for discrete data where the value corresponding to the next CF is taken: the 8th value is 3).

Position of $Q_3 = 3(32+1)/4 = 3(8.25) = 24.75$.
The 24th value corresponds to $x=4$ (CF=22). The 25th value corresponds to $x=5$ (CF=28).
Since the position is 24.75, $Q_3$ lies between the 24th and 25th value.
The 24th value is 4. The 25th value is 5.
Using standard quartile calculation for discrete data (often using interpolation or taking the value at the ceiling index, or taking the value corresponding to the first CF boundary exceeding the position):
The 24th value is 4 (since CF=22 ends at 4, and the 23rd, 24th values are 4).
The 25th value is 5.
If we use interpolation: $Q_3 = 4 + 0.75 \times (5-4) = 4.75$.
If we use the nearest data point based on the index, the 24th point is 4, the 25th is 5. We take the value at the index $ceil(24.75) = 25$, which corresponds to $x=5$ if using the inclusive method, or $x=4$ if strictly interpreting $Q_3$ as the median of the upper half.
Let's calculate the mean ($\bar{x}$) first to determine the appropriate method for Q1 and Q3 if there is ambiguity, but typically $Q_1$ is the 8th/9th observation and $Q_3$ is the 24th/25th observation.
8th observation: 3. 9th observation: 3. Thus $Q_1 = 3$.
24th observation: 4. 25th observation: 5.
We will use the formula for grouped data quartiles, treating the given $x_i$ values as midpoints, although they are exact discrete values:
$Q_1$: Position $8.25$. The 8th item falls in the class ending at $x=3$. $Q_1 = 3$.
$Q_3$: Position $24.75$. The 24th item is 4 (CF=22 ends at 4). The 25th item is 5 (CF=28 starts at 5).
If we use the standard statistical method for discrete data presentation: $Q_1$ is the value such that at least 25% of data is $\le Q_1$. 7 pupils are $\le 2$. 13 pupils are $\le 3$. So $Q_1=3$.
$Q_3$ is the value such that at least 75% of data is $\le Q_3$. 22 pupils are $\le 4$. 28 pupils are $\le 5$. So $Q_3=5$.
$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 = 5 - 3 = 2$ hours.

3. Mean ($\bar{x}$):
$\sum x_i f_i = (1\times 2) + (2\times 5) + (3\times 6) + (4\times 9) + (5\times 6) + (6\times 2) + (7\times 1) + (10\times 1)$
$\sum x_i f_i = 2 + 10 + 18 + 36 + 30 + 12 + 7 + 10 = 125$
$\bar{x} = \frac{125}{32} = 3.90625$ hours.

4. Variance ($\sigma^2$):
We calculate $\sum x_i^2 f_i$:
$\sum x_i^2 f_i = (1^2\times 2) + (2^2\times 5) + (3^2\times 6) + (4^2\times 9) + (5^2\times 6) + (6^2\times 2) + (7^2\times 1) + (10^2\times 1)$
$\sum x_i^2 f_i = (1\times 2) + (4\times 5) + (9\times 6) + (16\times 9) + (25\times 6) + (36\times 2) + (49\times 1) + (100\times 1)$
$\sum x_i^2 f_i = 2 + 20 + 54 + 144 + 150 + 72 + 49 + 100 = 591$

Using the computational formula for variance:
$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2 f_i}{N} - \bar{x}^2$
$\sigma^2 = \frac{591}{32} - \left(\frac{125}{32}\right)^2$
$\sigma^2 = 18.46875 - (3.90625)^2$
$\sigma^2 = 18.46875 - 15.2587890625$
$\sigma^2 = 3.2099609375$

Rounding to three significant figures (or standard precision):
$\sigma^2 \approx 3.21$ hours$^2$.

5. Standard Deviation ($\sigma$):
$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{3.2099609375}$
$\sigma \approx 1.791636$ hours.
Rounding to three significant figures:
$\sigma \approx 1.79$ hours.

b) Most Appropriate Measure of Dispersion:
The time data is quantitative (ratio scale), and the distribution appears to be somewhat skewed (due to the presence of the outlier value $x=10$, as the bulk of the data is concentrated around 3 and 4 hours).
Measures of dispersion are:
1. Range: Heavily affected by outliers (like 10) and sensitive to extreme values.
2. Interquartile Range (IQR): Robust against outliers, measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
3. Variance/Standard Deviation: Calculated using the mean, thus sensitive to outliers.

Since the distribution is discrete and potentially skewed by the value 10, the mean and standard deviation might not be the most representative measures of the ""typical"" spread. The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the most robust measure of dispersion when the data is skewed or contains significant outliers, as it is based on the median (which is more robust than the mean).

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) Calculations:
Range:
$R = 10 - 1 = 9$ hours.

Interquartile Range (IQR):
$Q_1$: The 8th or 9th observation is 3 hours.
$Q_3$: The 24th observation is 4 hours, the 25th is 5 hours. Using the standard convention for discrete data where $Q_3$ is the value at or before which 75% of the data lies, $Q_3=5$ hours (since 28/32 $\approx 87.5\%$ are $\le 5$).
$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 = 5 - 3 = 2$ hours.

Mean ($\bar{x}$):
$\bar{x} = 125 / 32 = 3.90625$ hours.

Variance ($\sigma^2$):
$\sigma^2 = \frac{591}{32} - (3.90625)^2 \approx 3.20996$
Variance $\approx 3.21$ hours$^2$ (to 3 s.f.).

Standard Deviation ($\sigma$):
$\sigma = \sqrt{3.20996} \approx 1.7916$
Standard Deviation $\approx 1.79$ hours (to 3 s.f.).

Summary of Part (a):
Range = 9 hours
Interquartile Range (IQR) = 2 hours
Variance $\approx 3.21$ hours$^2$
Standard Deviation $\approx 1.79$ hours

(b) Most appropriate measure of dispersion:
The most appropriate measure of dispersion is the Interquartile Range (IQR). This is because the distribution appears slightly skewed due to the maximum value (10 hours), making the mean-based measures (Variance and Standard Deviation) sensitive to this potential outlier, whereas the IQR is resistant to extreme values.

Boxed Answer Summary:
(a) Range: 9 hours
IQR: 2 hours
Variance: 3.21 hours$^2$ (3 s.f.)
Standard Deviation: 1.79 hours (3 s.f.)

(b) The most appropriate measure of dispersion is the Interquartile Range (IQR).",correct,3.8212199211120605,6,6,"Full marks awarded (6/6).

(b) 5, 3","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The general mathematical concept involved is Descriptive Statistics, specifically the calculation of measures of spread: the Range and the Interquartile Range (IQR) for grouped frequency data.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The image provides two sets of grouped frequency data, labeled (a) and (b).

For both sets, the data consists of distinct values ($x_i$) and their corresponding frequencies ($f_i$).

Data Set (a): Limes Diameter (cm)
| Diameter ($x_i$) | Frequency ($f_i$) |

| 6.6 | 18 |
| 6.8 | 20 |
| 7.0 | 10 |
| 7.2 | 5 |

Total number of data points, $N_a = 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 80$.

Data Set (b): Age (years)

| 18 | 8 |

Total number of data points, $N_b = 12 + 18 + 21 + 20 + 21 + 8 = 100$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to calculate two statistical measures for each dataset:
1. Range: Maximum Value - Minimum Value.
2. Interquartile Range (IQR): $Q_3 - Q_1$, where $Q_1$ is the first quartile (25th percentile) and $Q_3$ is the third quartile (75th percentile). For grouped data, the position of the quartiles is determined using the total frequency $N$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

For Range ($R$):
$R = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}$

For Interquartile Range ($IQR$):
The position of the $p$-th percentile (or quartile) is generally determined by the index $L_p = \frac{p}{100} \times N$. Since the data values are discrete and ordered, we find the value corresponding to the cumulative frequency that exceeds this index.
$Q_1$ position index: $L_{25} = 0.25 \times N$
$Q_3$ position index: $L_{75} = 0.75 \times N$
$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

---
Calculation for Data Set (a): (N = 80)

1. Range for (a):
$x_{\text{max}} = 7.2$ cm
$x_{\text{min}} = 6.0$ cm
$R_a = 7.2 - 6.0 = 1.2$ cm

2. Interquartile Range for (a):
First, calculate the cumulative frequencies (CF):
| Diameter ($x_i$) | Frequency ($f_i$) | Cumulative Frequency (CF) |

| 6.6 | 18 | 45 |
| 6.8 | 20 | 65 |
| 7.0 | 10 | 75 |
| 7.2 | 5 | 80 |

Calculate $Q_1$ position: $L_{25} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20$.
$Q_1$ is the value corresponding to the 20th observation. Since CF reaches 15 at 6.2 and 27 at 6.4, the 20th observation falls into the class where $x_i = 6.4$.
$Q_1 = 6.4$

Calculate $Q_3$ position: $L_{75} = 0.75 \times 80 = 60$.
$Q_3$ is the value corresponding to the 60th observation. Since CF reaches 45 at 6.6 and 65 at 6.8, the 60th observation falls into the class where $x_i = 6.8$.
$Q_3 = 6.8$

$IQR_a = Q_3 - Q_1 = 6.8 - 6.4 = 0.4$ cm

$Q_1$ is the value corresponding to the 25th observation. Since CF reaches 12 at 13 and 30 at 14, the 25th observation falls into the class where $x_i = 14$.
$Q_1 = 14$

Calculate $Q_3$ position: $L_{75} = 0.75 \times 100 = 75$.
$Q_3$ is the value corresponding to the 75th observation. Since CF reaches 71 at 16 and 92 at 17, the 75th observation falls into the class where $x_i = 17$.

The problem requires the calculation and comparison of descriptive statistics for two small, ungrouped data sets (masses of players in two teams). The required statistics are measures of central tendency (mean) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, and standard deviation). The final parts require qualitative assessment of the range as a measure of dispersion and comparison of the overall dispersion using the calculated statistics.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The data provided is in a table format:
Data Set A ($X_A$): 48, 53, 65, 69, 70
Data Set B ($X_B$): 45, 47, 68, 70, 75
Number of observations for both teams, $N = 5$.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The question has three parts:
(a) Calculate Mean ($\bar{x}$), Range ($R$), Variance ($\sigma^2$), and Standard Deviation ($\sigma$) for both Team A and Team B.
(b) Determine if the Range ($R$) is an appropriate measure of dispersion for this data and justify the answer.
(c) Determine which team has a greater dispersion from the mean, using the calculated statistics for justification.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Let $x_i$ be the individual mass measurements for a team. $N=5$.

Formulas:
1. Mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{N}$
2. Range: $R = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}$
3. Variance (Population or Sample? Since these are the masses of *players in* the teams, we typically treat this as the entire population of interest for comparison, so population variance formula is often used in introductory settings unless specified otherwise. We will use the population variance formula: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N}$. If sample variance ($s^2$) were required, the denominator would be $N-1$. We proceed with population variance $\sigma^2$):
   $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N}$
4. Standard Deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Calculations for Team A ($X_A = \{48, 53, 65, 69, 70\}$)

1. Mean ($\bar{x}_A$):
   $\sum x_i = 48 + 53 + 65 + 69 + 70 = 305$
   $\bar{x}_A = \frac{305}{5} = 61$ kg

2. Range ($R_A$):
   $x_{\text{max}} = 70$, $x_{\text{min}} = 48$
   $R_A = 70 - 48 = 22$ kg

3. Variance ($\sigma_A^2$):
   Calculate deviations squared $(x_i - \bar{x}_A)^2$:
   $(48 - 61)^2 = (-13)^2 = 169$
   $(53 - 61)^2 = (-8)^2 = 64$
   $(65 - 61)^2 = (4)^2 = 16$
   $(69 - 61)^2 = (8)^2 = 64$
   $(70 - 61)^2 = (9)^2 = 81$
   $\sum (x_i - \bar{x}_A)^2 = 169 + 64 + 16 + 64 + 81 = 394$
   $\sigma_A^2 = \frac{394}{5} = 78.8$

4. Standard Deviation ($\sigma_A$):
   $\sigma_A = \sqrt{78.8} \approx 8.8770$ (Rounding to 3 significant figures: 8.88 kg)

Calculations for Team B ($X_B = \{45, 47, 68, 70, 75\}$)

1. Mean ($\bar{x}_B$):
   $\sum x_i = 45 + 47 + 68 + 70 + 75 = 305$
   $\bar{x}_B = \frac{305}{5} = 61$ kg

2. Range ($R_B$):
   $x_{\text{max}} = 75$, $x_{\text{min}} = 45$
   $R_B = 75 - 45 = 30$ kg

3. Variance ($\sigma_B^2$):
   Calculate deviations squared $(x_i - \bar{x}_B)^2$:
   $(45 - 61)^2 = (-16)^2 = 256$
   $(47 - 61)^2 = (-14)^2 = 196$
   $(68 - 61)^2 = (7)^2 = 49$

   $(75 - 61)^2 = (14)^2 = 196$
   $\sum (x_i - \bar{x}_B)^2 = 256 + 196 + 49 + 81 + 196 = 778$
   $\sigma_B^2 = \frac{778}{5} = 155.6$

4. Standard Deviation ($\sigma_B$):
   $\sigma_B = \sqrt{155.6} \approx 12.4740$ (Rounding to 3 significant figures: 12.5 kg)

Summary for Part (a):
| Statistic | Team A | Team B |
|---|---|---|
| Mean ($\bar{x}$) | 61 kg | 61 kg |
| Range ($R$) | 22 kg | 30 kg |
| Variance ($\sigma^2$) | 78.8 | 155.6 |
| Standard Deviation ($\sigma$) | 8.88 kg (approx) | 12.5 kg (approx) |

Part (b): Appropriateness of the Range
The range is calculated using only the minimum and maximum values.
For Team A: $R_A = 22$.
For Team B: $R_B = 30$.
Justification: The range is generally considered an inappropriate measure of dispersion for describing the entire data set because it is heavily influenced by outliers (the minimum and maximum values) and ignores the distribution and behavior of all the intermediate data points. Since both teams have 5 data points, ignoring 3 points in the calculation is significant.

Part (c): Greater Dispersion from the Mean
Dispersion from the mean is best represented by the standard deviation ($\sigma$) or variance ($\sigma^2$).
We compare:
Standard Deviation: $\sigma_A \approx 8.88$ kg and $\sigma_B \approx 12.5$ kg.
Since $\sigma_B > \sigma_A$ (or $\sigma_B^2 > \sigma_A^2$), Team B has greater dispersion from the mean.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) Calculations for the masses of players in both teams (using population statistics):

Team A:
Mean ($\bar{x}_A$): $61$ kg
Range ($R_A$): $22$ kg
Variance ($\sigma_A^2$): $78.8$
Standard Deviation ($\sigma_A$): $\sqrt{78.8} \approx 8.88$ kg (to 3 s.f.)

Team B:
Mean ($\bar{x}_B$): $61$ kg
Range ($R_B$): $30$ kg
Variance ($\sigma_B^2$): $155.6$
Standard Deviation ($\sigma_B$): $\sqrt{155.6} \approx 12.5$ kg (to 3 s.f.)

(b) Is the range appropriate to be used as a measure of dispersion to represent the data above? Justify your answer.
No, the range is generally not appropriate as a primary measure of dispersion because it only considers the extreme values (maximum and minimum) and ignores how the middle 60% (3 out of 5 data points) of the data are distributed.

(c) Determine the mass of which team has a greater dispersion from the mean.
Team B has a greater dispersion from the mean. This is determined by comparing the standard deviations:
$\sigma_B \approx 12.5$ kg is greater than $\sigma_A \approx 8.88$ kg.

The problem involves calculating the probability of an event occurring when two independent selections are made from two separate sets (Box K and Box L). Specifically, the question asks for the probability of Event A OR Event B occurring, where A is drawing a specific card from Box K, and B is drawing a specific type of card from Box L. Since the selections are independent, the probability of (A AND B) is $P(A) \times P(B)$. The required calculation involves the addition rule for probability of events that are not mutually exclusive, $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$, but since the events (drawing from K and drawing from L) are independent, $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B)$. The problem also explicitly asks to list all possible outcomes (the sample space).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
Box K contains four cards with letters: $\{S, E, R, I\}$.
Total outcomes in Box K, $N_K = 4$.
Box L contains three cards with numbers: $\{4, 5, 6\}$.
Total outcomes in Box L, $N_L = 3$.

The required events are:
Event A: Getting a letter ""S"" from Box K.
Event B: Getting a multiple of 3 from Box L.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to calculate the probability of getting ""S"" from Box K OR a multiple of 3 from Box L. This is $P(A \text{ or } B)$. We must first list the complete sample space of outcomes formed by pairing one draw from K with one draw from L.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Let $K$ be the result from Box K, and $L$ be the result from Box L.
The sample space $S$ consists of all ordered pairs $(K, L)$:
$S = \{(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6), (E, 4), (E, 5), (E, 6), (R, 4), (R, 5), (R, 6), (I, 4), (I, 5), (I, 6)\}$.
The total number of outcomes in the sample space is $|S| = N_K \times N_L = 4 \times 3 = 12$.

Define Event A: Getting ""S"" from Box K.
$A = \{(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6)\}$.
$|A| = 3$.
$P(A) = |A| / |S| = 3 / 12 = 1/4$. (Alternatively, $P(S \text{ from } K) = 1/4$).

Define Event B: Getting a multiple of 3 from Box L.
The numbers in Box L are $\{4, 5, 6\}$. The multiple of 3 in this set is $\{6\}$.
$B = \{(S, 6), (E, 6), (R, 6), (I, 6)\}$.
$|B| = 4$.
$P(B) = |B| / |S| = 4 / 12 = 1/3$. (Alternatively, $P(\text{multiple of 3 from } L) = 1/3$).

We need to calculate $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A \cup B)$.
Since A and B are outcomes derived from independent selections, the formula is:
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.
Since the events are independent (drawing from K is independent of drawing from L), $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

1. List all possible outcomes (Sample Space $S$):
(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6)
(E, 4), (E, 5), (E, 6)
(R, 4), (R, 5), (R, 6)
(I, 4), (I, 5), (I, 6)
Total outcomes $|S| = 12$.

2. Calculate $P(A)$: Probability of getting ""S"" from Box K.
$P(A) = P(S \text{ from } K) = 1/4$.

3. Calculate $P(B)$: Probability of getting a multiple of 3 (which is 6) from Box L.
$P(B) = P(6 \text{ from } L) = 1/3$.

4. Calculate $P(A \cap B)$: Probability of getting ""S"" AND a multiple of 3 (i.e., outcome (S, 6)).
Since the events are independent:
$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = (1/4) \times (1/3) = 1/12$.
Alternatively, by counting outcomes in $S$: The outcome (S, 6) occurs exactly once, so $P(A \cap B) = 1/12$.

5. Calculate $P(A \text{ or } B)$:
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
$P(A \cup B) = 1/4 + 1/3 - 1/12$

Find a common denominator, which is 12:
$P(A \cup B) = (3/12) + (4/12) - (1/12)$
$P(A \cup B) = (3 + 4 - 1) / 12$
$P(A \cup B) = 6 / 12$
$P(A \cup B) = 1/2$.

Alternative calculation by counting favorable outcomes ($A \cup B$):
Outcomes in A (S from K): (S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6) (3 outcomes)
Outcomes in B (6 from L): (S, 6), (E, 6), (R, 6), (I, 6) (4 outcomes)
The union $A \cup B$ includes all outcomes listed in A plus any outcomes in B not already listed in A. The outcome (S, 6) is common.
Favorable outcomes: (S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6), (E, 6), (R, 6), (I, 6).
Total favorable outcomes $|A \cup B| = 6$.
$P(A \cup B) = |A \cup B| / |S| = 6 / 12 = 1/2$.

Step 5: Final Answer
The probability of getting a letter ""S"" from box K or a multiple of 3 from box L is 1/2.

The list of all possible outcomes is:
(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6), (E, 4), (E, 5), (E, 6), (R, 4), (R, 5), (R, 6), (I, 4), (I, 5), (I, 6).

The problem involves calculating the expected total number of a specific outcome (RM10 vouchers) over a fixed number of independent trials (450 customers), where each trial consists of a sequence of probabilistic events (spinning the wheel and selecting a box). This falls under the principle of Expected Value applied iteratively or the calculation of the total expected count based on compound probability.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram and tables provide the following key features:
1. Lucky Wheel: Six similar sectors.
    * Number of Red sectors (R): 2
    * Number of Yellow sectors (Y): $6 - 2 = 4$
    * Probability of Red sector, P(R) = $2/6 = 1/3$
    * Probability of Yellow sector, P(Y) = $4/6 = 2/3$
2. Voucher Selection Rule:
    * If Red (R), choose from Box A.
    * If Yellow (Y), choose from Box B.
3. Voucher Contents (Number of Vouchers):
    | Box | RM50 Vouchers | RM10 Vouchers | Total Vouchers |
    | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | A | 20 | 5 | $20 + 5 = 25$ |
    | B | 10 | 20 | $10 + 20 = 30$ |
4. Total Customers (Trials), $N$: 450.
5. Requirement: Calculate the total number of RM10 vouchers needed.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is to calculate the total expected number of RM10 vouchers distributed to 450 customers. This requires finding the probability that a single customer receives an RM10 voucher and then multiplying this probability by the total number of customers (450).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Let $V_{10}$ be the event that a customer receives an RM10 voucher.
The event $V_{10}$ can only occur if the customer spins Red AND draws from Box A, OR if the customer spins Yellow AND draws from Box B.

Probability of drawing an RM10 voucher given the selection path:
1. Path A (Red Spin): Customer draws from Box A.
   $P(\text{RM10} | A) = \frac{\text{Number of RM10 in A}}{\text{Total in A}} = \frac{5}{25} = \frac{1}{5}$
2. Path B (Yellow Spin): Customer draws from Box B.
   $P(\text{RM10} | B) = \frac{\text{Number of RM10 in B}}{\text{Total in B}} = \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}$

The total probability of receiving an RM10 voucher, $P(V_{10})$, is calculated using the law of total probability:
$P(V_{10}) = P(V_{10} | R) \cdot P(R) + P(V_{10} | Y) \cdot P(Y)$
Since drawing from A is conditional on R, $P(V_{10} | R) = P(\text{RM10} | A)$.
Since drawing from B is conditional on Y, $P(V_{10} | Y) = P(\text{RM10} | B)$.

$P(V_{10}) = P(\text{RM10} | A) \cdot P(R) + P(\text{RM10} | B) \cdot P(Y)$

The total estimated number of RM10 vouchers required, $E_{10}$, is:
$E_{10} = N \times P(V_{10})$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Calculate the probabilities of spinning Red (R) or Yellow (Y):
   $P(R) = 1/3$
   $P(Y) = 2/3$

2. Calculate the conditional probabilities of getting an RM10 voucher:
   $P(\text{RM10} | A) = 5 / (20 + 5) = 5/25 = 1/5$
   $P(\text{RM10} | B) = 20 / (10 + 20) = 20/30 = 2/3$

3. Calculate the total probability $P(V_{10})$:
   $P(V_{10}) = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)$
   $P(V_{10}) = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{4}{9}$

4. Find a common denominator for the addition (LCM of 15 and 9 is 45):
   $P(V_{10}) = \frac{1 \times 3}{15 \times 3} + \frac{4 \times 5}{9 \times 5}$
   $P(V_{10}) = \frac{3}{45} + \frac{20}{45}$
   $P(V_{10}) = \frac{23}{45}$

5. Calculate the total estimated number of RM10 vouchers needed for $N=450$ customers:
   $E_{10} = 450 \times P(V_{10})$
   $E_{10} = 450 \times \frac{23}{45}$

6. Simplify the calculation:
   $E_{10} = \left(\frac{450}{45}\right) \times 23$
   Since $450 / 45 = 10$:
   $E_{10} = 10 \times 23$
   $E_{10} = 230$

Step 5: Final Answer
The number of RM10 vouchers the Naga Shop needs to prepare is 230.

(b) 5/33","Step 0: Principle Abstraction
The problem involves calculating probabilities based on selections from distinct, finite sets (club types in specific locations). Since two clubs (one badminton, one bodybuilding) are selected simultaneously or sequentially without replacement regarding their type constraints, the core mathematical principle is basic probability, specifically calculating the probability of independent or dependent events occurring based on the counts extracted from the provided data visualization. The structure of the selection implies calculating the probability of an intersection of events or conditional selection based on the total population.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The diagram is a stacked bar chart showing the number of Badminton clubs (grey) and Bodybuilding clubs (light blue) across four geographical regions: Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, F.T. Labuan, and F.T. Putrajaya.

Data Extraction:
Let $B$ denote Badminton clubs and $W$ denote Bodybuilding clubs.

Kedah (K): $N_{K,B} = 14$, $N_{K,W} = 6$. Total clubs in Kedah: $T_K = 14 + 6 = 20$.
Negeri Sembilan (NS): $N_{NS,B} = 11$, $N_{NS,W} = 2$. Total clubs in Negeri Sembilan: $T_{NS} = 11 + 2 = 13$.
F.T. Labuan (L): $N_{L,B} = 3$, $N_{L,W} = 2$. Total clubs in Labuan: $T_{L} = 3 + 2 = 5$.
F.T. Putrajaya (P): $N_{P,B} = 5$, $N_{P,W} = 2$. Total clubs in Putrajaya: $T_{P} = 5 + 2 = 7$.

Total number of Badminton clubs ($N_B$): $14 + 11 + 3 + 5 = 33$.
Total number of Bodybuilding clubs ($N_W$): $6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12$.
Grand Total Number of Clubs ($N_{Total}$): $33 + 12 = 45$.

The selection process is described as: ""A badminton club and a bodybuilding club in the four states are selected at random."" This implies two separate random selections occur: one from the set of all Badminton clubs, and one from the set of all Bodybuilding clubs. The selections are independent because the pool for the Badminton club selection is separate from the pool for the Bodybuilding club selection, even though they are constrained by location in subsequent parts.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The problem asks to calculate the probability for two scenarios involving the selection of one Badminton club and one Bodybuilding club from the total pool of these clubs across the four states.

(a) Calculate $P(\text{Both selected clubs are from Kedah})$.
This means: $P(\text{Badminton club is from Kedah AND Bodybuilding club is from Kedah})$.

(b) Calculate $P(\text{A club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively})$.
This phrasing is slightly ambiguous regarding which club type comes from which location. Given the setup requires selecting one Badminton club and one Bodybuilding club, ""respectively"" usually implies an order assigned to the selection types. We must consider the two possible interpretations:
Interpretation 1 (Standard ordering based on the initial problem setup: 1st selection = Badminton, 2nd selection = Bodybuilding):
$P[ (B \text{ from FTs AND } W \text{ from NS}) \text{ OR } (B \text{ from NS AND } W \text{ from FTs}) ]$
Interpretation 2 (More direct reading: One club type from the combined FTs, the other from NS):
This interpretation seems less likely given the required structure of selecting one of each type. Let's proceed with Interpretation 1, breaking down Federal Territories (FTs) into Labuan (L) and Putrajaya (P).

Federal Territories (FTs) total:
Total FT Badminton: $N_{FT,B} = N_{L,B} + N_{P,B} = 3 + 5 = 8$.
Total FT Bodybuilding: $N_{FT,W} = N_{L,W} + N_{P,W} = 2 + 2 = 4$.

Negeri Sembilan (NS) totals:
$N_{NS,B} = 11$, $N_{NS,W} = 2$.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

Part (a): Both clubs from Kedah.
Let $E_a$ be the event that the selected Badminton club is from Kedah AND the selected Bodybuilding club is from Kedah. Since the selection pools are independent:
$P(E_a) = P(B \text{ from K}) \times P(W \text{ from K})$
$P(B \text{ from K}) = \frac{\text{Number of Badminton clubs in Kedah}}{\text{Total Badminton clubs}} = \frac{N_{K,B}}{N_B}$
$P(W \text{ from K}) = \frac{\text{Number of Bodybuilding clubs in Kedah}}{\text{Total Bodybuilding clubs}} = \frac{N_{K,W}}{N_W}$

Part (b): One club from Federal Territories (FTs) and one club from Negeri Sembilan (NS).
The selection involves choosing one Badminton club and one Bodybuilding club. We must match the locations to the club types selected. Assuming the order of mention in the question (""Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively"") refers to the types (Badminton then Bodybuilding):
Event $E_{b1}$: Badminton club from FTs AND Bodybuilding club from NS.
$P(E_{b1}) = P(B \text{ from FTs}) \times P(W \text{ from NS})$
$P(B \text{ from FTs}) = \frac{N_{FT,B}}{N_B}$
$P(W \text{ from NS}) = \frac{N_{NS,W}}{N_W}$

The word ""respectively"" might also imply that the two club types (Badminton and Bodybuilding) are assigned to the two location groups (FTs and NS) in some order. Since the phrasing ""a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively"" does not explicitly assign which club type (B or W) corresponds to which location group (FT or NS), we must consider both ways the location assignment can map to the club type selection:

Case 1: Badminton from FTs AND Bodybuilding from NS. (This is $E_{b1}$ above)
Case 2: Badminton from NS AND Bodybuilding from FTs.
$P(E_{b2}) = P(B \text{ from NS}) \times P(W \text{ from FTs})$
$P(B \text{ from NS}) = \frac{N_{NS,B}}{N_B}$
$P(W \text{ from FTs}) = \frac{N_{FT,W}}{N_W}$

Since these two cases are mutually exclusive, the total probability $P(E_b)$ is the sum of the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2.
$P(E_b) = P(E_{b1}) + P(E_{b2})$

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Pre-calculation of Totals:
$N_B = 33$
$N_W = 12$

Federal Territories Totals:
$N_{FT,B} = 8$
$N_{FT,W} = 4$

Negeri Sembilan Totals:
$N_{NS,B} = 11$
$N_{NS,W} = 2$
Kedah Totals:
$N_{K,B} = 14$
$N_{K,W} = 6$

Part (a): Probability that both clubs are from Kedah.
$P(B \text{ from K}) = \frac{N_{K,B}}{N_B} = \frac{14}{33}$
$P(W \text{ from K}) = \frac{N_{K,W}}{N_W} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$
$P(E_a) = P(B \text{ from K}) \times P(W \text{ from K}) = \frac{14}{33} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{14}{66} = \frac{7}{33}$

Part (b): Probability of selecting one club from FTs and one club from NS.

Case 1 ($E_{b1}$): Badminton from FTs AND Bodybuilding from NS.
$P(B \text{ from FTs}) = \frac{N_{FT,B}}{N_B} = \frac{8}{33}$
$P(W \text{ from NS}) = \frac{N_{NS,W}}{N_W} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}$
$P(E_{b1}) = \frac{8}{33} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{198} = \frac{4}{99}$

Case 2 ($E_{b2}$): Badminton from NS AND Bodybuilding from FTs.
$P(B \text{ from NS}) = \frac{N_{NS,B}}{N_B} = \frac{11}{33} = \frac{1}{3}$
$P(W \text{ from FTs}) = \frac{N_{FT,W}}{N_W} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}$
$P(E_{b2}) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$

Total Probability for (b):
$P(E_b) = P(E_{b1}) + P(E_{b2}) = \frac{4}{99} + \frac{1}{9}$
To add these fractions, find a common denominator (99):
$\frac{1}{9} = \frac{1 \times 11}{9 \times 11} = \frac{11}{99}$
$P(E_b) = \frac{4}{99} + \frac{11}{99} = \frac{15}{99}$
Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:
$P(E_b) = \frac{15 \div 3}{99 \div 3} = \frac{5}{33}$

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) The probability that both clubs selected are from Kedah is $\frac{7}{33}$.

(b) The probability that one club is selected from the Federal Territories and the other from Negeri Sembilan (interpreting this as one club type originating from the FTs and the other club type originating from NS, covering both possible assignments) is $\frac{5}{33}$.

1. Monthly Net Salary (Engineer): RM 3800
2. Monthly Commission (Part-time): RM 450
3. Monthly Rental Income (Second house): RM 600

Mandatory Savings Requirement:
1. Fixed Monthly Savings: 10% of Salary (RM 3800)

Monthly Expenses (Table Data):
1. Housing loan instalment (1): RM 800
2. Housing loan instalment (2): RM 500
3. Food expenses: RM 900
4. Utility payments: RM 150
5. Toll and petrol expenses: RM 200
6. Internet service subscription: RM 100
7. Eat at a luxury restaurant: RM 400
8. Insurance expenses: RM 350

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The goal is twofold:
(a) Create a monthly personal financial plan for Encik Nabil, which requires summarizing Income, Savings, and Expenses, and calculating the resulting balance (Surplus/Deficit).
(b) Provide comments on the calculated surplus or deficit based on the financial plan created in part (a).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
The core equations required are:

1. Total Monthly Income (I): Sum of all income sources.
   $I = \text{Salary} + \text{Commission} + \text{Rental Income}$

2. Fixed Monthly Savings (S): 10% of the Salary.
   $S = 0.10 \times \text{Salary}$

3. Total Monthly Expenses (E): Sum of all listed expenses.
   $E = \sum (\text{All Expenses})$

4. Financial Balance (B): The net result.
   $B = I - S - E$
   If $B > 0$, it is a Surplus.
   If $B < 0$, it is a Deficit.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Creating the Financial Plan

1. Calculate Total Monthly Income (I):
   $I = 3800 + 450 + 600$
   $I = RM 4850$

2. Calculate Fixed Monthly Savings (S):
   $S = 0.10 \times 3800$
   $S = RM 380$

3. Calculate Total Monthly Expenses (E):
   $E = 800 + 500 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350$
   $E = 1300 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350$
   $E = 2200 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350$
   $E = 2350 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350$
   $E = 2550 + 100 + 400 + 350$
   $E = 2650 + 400 + 350$
   $E = 3050 + 350$
   $E = RM 3400$

4. Calculate Financial Balance (B):
   $B = I - S - E$
   $B = 4850 - 380 - 3400$
   $B = 4470 - 3400$
   $B = RM 1070$

Summary for Financial Plan (Part a):
Total Income = RM 4850
Total Savings = RM 380
Total Expenses = RM 3400
Surplus/Deficit = RM 1070 (Surplus)

Part (b): Comments on Surplus or Deficit

The resulting balance is a Surplus of RM 1070.

Comments should address the health of the budget:
1. The budget is currently positive (surplus), meaning Encik Nabil earns more than he spends and saves according to his plan.
2. The mandatory savings goal (RM 380) is met.
3. A significant surplus (RM 1070) remains, which can be allocated toward additional financial goals (e.g., discretionary spending, retirement, property investment, emergency fund building).
4. It is worth noting that his spending on ""Eat at a luxury restaurant"" (RM 400) is relatively high, which he may choose to reduce if he wishes to maximize his surplus.

Step 5: Final Answer

(a) Monthly Personal Financial Plan for Encik Nabil:

| Category | Details | Amount (RM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Monthly Income** | Salary + Commission + Rental | 4850 |
| **Fixed Savings** | 10% of Salary (3800) | 380 |
| **Total Monthly Expenses** | Sum of all listed expenses | 3400 |
| **Financial Balance** | Income - Savings - Expenses | 1070 |

(b) Comments on the surplus or deficit:

The financial plan results in a monthly **Surplus of RM 1070**. This indicates that Encik Nabil's current income covers his required fixed savings and all estimated expenses, leaving a substantial positive cash flow of RM 1070 remaining after mandatory financial commitments. This surplus provides excellent flexibility for discretionary spending or for accelerating progress towards other financial goals.

The problem involves basic financial accounting, specifically budgeting, analysis of income versus expenses, calculating surpluses/deficits, and projecting future savings based on a current balance. The core principles are arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and simple future value projection (multiplication).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
The image provides a personal budget table for Mrs. Thong.

Key Data Extracted:
Net Income (Salary): RM 6,000
Total Expenses (Sum of all budgeted items): RM 5,750
Income Balance (Surplus): RM 250 (Calculated as 6000 - 5750)

Expense Breakdown (for qualitative analysis in part a):
House/apartment loan: 500
Car instalment: 700
Travel: 500
Rental: 1,500
Transport fares: 900
Utility bills: 250
Toll payments: 100
Groceries: 400
Allowances for parents: 600
Savings: 100
Insurance: 200
Total Expenses: 5,750

Long-term Goal Data (for part b):
Target Property Value: RM 500,000
Time Horizon: 6 years

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The question has two parts:
(a) Assess the wisdom of Mrs. Thong's current spending behavior based on the budget (qualitative assessment based on surplus and expense allocation).
(b) Determine if she can afford the RM 500,000 property in 6 years, assuming her current surplus (RM 250/month) is the only source of additional funds for the purchase, and assuming the current savings amount (RM 100/month) continues as is. (Note: The problem structure suggests we must compare the required savings rate vs the current savings/surplus rate).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Part (a): Qualitative assessment of wise spending. This involves checking if Income > Expenses and analyzing the proportion of funds allocated to needs versus wants, and savings rates.

Part (b): Calculation of total projected savings and comparison to the target goal.
1. Calculate Total Current Monthly Savings/Surplus: S_current = Income Balance (Surplus) + Current Savings.
   S_current = RM 250 + RM 100 = RM 350 per month. (This is the total amount potentially available for the property goal, assuming the RM 100 savings is re-directed or augmented by the surplus). *Self-Correction/Clarification*: A ""wise"" plan should ideally separate planned savings from surplus. For the goal calculation, the surplus (RM 250) is the *extra* money available beyond the current plan, while the RM 100 listed under ""Savings"" is already allocated in the budget. To achieve the goal, she needs to accumulate funds. The most aggressive accumulation rate, assuming the goal is funded by *all* disposable income, is the Income Balance (Surplus) plus planned Savings. However, since ""Savings"" is listed separately, we should calculate the total accumulation rate: Monthly Accumulation Rate (MAR) = Income Balance + Existing Savings.
   MAR = RM 250 + RM 100 = RM 350 per month.

2. Calculate Total Projected Savings over 6 years:
   Total Months (T_m) = 6 years * 12 months/year = 72 months.
   Total Projected Funds (P) = MAR * T_m.

3. Compare Projected Funds (P) with Target Property Value (V_target = RM 500,000).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a): Does Mrs. Thong spend her money wisely?
1. Income vs. Expenses Check:
   Income (RM 6,000) > Total Expenses (RM 5,750).
   Income Balance (Surplus) = RM 250. Since she has a positive balance, she is not overspending her income.

2. Analysis of Expense Allocation:
   Major Expenses: Rental (1500), Car (700), Allowances (600), Transport (900).
   Housing/Transport related costs: 500 (loan) + 1500 (rental) + 700 (car) + 900 (fares) + 100 (tolls) = RM 3,700. This is a very high proportion of her RM 6,000 income (61.7%).
   Savings Rate: Current Savings is RM 100 out of RM 6,000, which is only about 1.67% of her income. A generally recommended savings rate is 10% or more.
   Conclusion for (a): While she manages to have a surplus, her spending is heavily skewed toward housing, car payments, and transport, leaving very little for dedicated savings (only RM 100). Therefore, her plan prioritizes current lifestyle/debt servicing over aggressive long-term wealth building, suggesting it is not optimally ""wise"" for significant long-term goals, despite being solvent.

Part (b): Projection for RM 500,000 property in 6 years.
1. Calculate Maximum Monthly Accumulation Rate (MAR) based on current surplus and existing savings allocation:
   MAR = Income Balance + Savings
   MAR = RM 250 + RM 100 = RM 350 per month.

2. Calculate Total Months:
   T_m = 6 years * 12 months/year = 72 months.

3. Calculate Total Projected Funds (P) in 6 years:
   P = MAR * T_m
   P = RM 350/month * 72 months
   P = RM 25,200.

4. Comparison:
   Projected Funds (P) = RM 25,200
   Target Value (V_target) = RM 500,000

   Since RM 25,200 is significantly less than RM 500,000, she will not achieve her goal with her current saving/surplus behavior.

5. Calculation of required monthly savings to reach the goal:
   Required Monthly Rate (RMR) = V_target / T_m
   RMR = RM 500,000 / 72
   RMR $\approx$ RM 6,944.44 per month.
   Since her total net income is only RM 6,000, it is mathematically impossible to achieve this goal in 6 years based on her current income, even if she saved 100% of it (minus taxes/essentials not listed).

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) Does Mrs. Thong spend her money wisely?
Mrs. Thong's plan results in a surplus of RM 250 per month, meaning she is solvent. However, her expenses are very high, particularly in housing, car, and transport, consuming RM 3,700 (61.7% of income). Her dedicated savings component is only RM 100 (1.67% of income). While she is managing her existing commitments, this spending pattern does not prioritize aggressive long-term financial goals due to the low savings rate relative to her income level. Therefore, she is managing her budget but not spending optimally wisely for significant future investments.

(b) Will Mrs. Thong be able to achieve her long-term financial goal if she wishes to buy a property worth RM500 000 within 6 years with her current spending behaviour?
No, Mrs. Thong will not be able to achieve her goal.

Calculation:
Total available monthly accumulation (Surplus + Current Savings) = RM 250 + RM 100 = RM 350 per month.
Total time = 6 years * 12 months/year = 72 months.
Total projected funds after 6 years = RM 350 * 72 = RM 25,200.
Since the target property value is RM 500,000, and she will only accumulate RM 25,200, the goal is unattainable under these conditions. Furthermore, the required monthly saving rate to reach RM 500,000 in 72 months is RM 500,000 / 72 $\approx$ RM 6,944.44, which exceeds her entire net income of RM 6,000.",correct,7.372847318649292,6,6,"Full marks awarded (6/6) because the AI's answers match the ground truth conclusions for both parts: (a) it correctly concludes Mrs Thong does not spend wisely, citing a very low effective savings rate relative to income; (b) it correctly concludes she cannot reach a RM500,000 goal in 6 years with her current finances and demonstrates this with a projection showing accumulated funds far below RM500,000 and by noting the required monthly saving exceeds her income. Although the AI combined the RM250 surplus with the RM100 budgeted savings to compute a RM350 monthly accumulation (a minor difference in interpretation versus the ground truth's statement that monthly savings are RM250), this does not change the final judgments, so the response matches the ground truth and receives full marks per the provided marking scheme.",13.032313346862793,, Financial Management,English,gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025,4838
