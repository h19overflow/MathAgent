Out of 29 evaluated responses, 19 received full marks, while 10 responses had errors resulting in a loss of marks. The 22 total lost marks are distributed across four main categories of mistakes.
Summary of Mistake Categories
Mistake Category	Number of Occurrences	Total Marks Lost
Conceptual / Methodological 	4	10
Omission / Incomplete Answer	3	5
Arithmetic / Calculation Error	2	4
Misinterpretation of Question	1	3
Total	10	22
Detailed Breakdown of Each Category
1. Conceptual / Methodological Error
This was the most significant category, responsible for the largest number of lost marks. These errors occurred when the AI used an incorrect method, applied a wrong formula, or failed to correctly model the mathematical aspects of the problem, particularly in graphing inequalities.
Number of Occurrences: 4
Total Marks Lost: 10
Examples:
A score of 0/5 was given for failing to correctly calculate any values from a speed-time graph, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the methodology.
Three separate instances involving graphing linear inequalities resulted in a combined loss of 5 marks (1/4, 2/3, and 3/4) due to errors like misidentifying boundary lines, using incorrect inequality directions (e.g., > vs. <), and omitting required boundary conditions.
2. Omission / Incomplete Answer
This category includes cases where the AI failed to provide an answer for one or more parts of a question or omitted a required value from its final answer.
Number of Occurrences: 3
Total Marks Lost: 5
Examples:
Two marks were lost for not providing an answer to part (b) of a four-mark question.
Another two marks were lost for failing to compute the final numerical results (total distance and average speed) in the last part of a question, despite correctly describing the preceding steps.
One mark was lost when a correct number identified during the working process was left out of the final list in the answer.
3. Arithmetic / Calculation Error
These errors happened when the AI's methodology was correct, but a mistake in basic calculations led to an incorrect final answer.
Number of Occurrences: 2
Total Marks Lost: 4
Examples:
A critical error in summing a list of incomes led to an incorrect financial surplus, resulting in a loss of 2 marks.
An incorrect calculation for the sum of squares (Σfx²) in a statistics problem led to wrong values for variance and standard deviation, costing 2 marks.
4. Misinterpretation of Question
This error type occurred when the AI misunderstood the core objective or a specific non-mathematical condition of the problem.
Number of Occurrences: 1
Total Marks Lost: 3
Example:
In a route-planning problem, the AI found the shortest route by distance when the question asked for the "best" route, which was defined as the safest. This misinterpretation of the objective led to a score of 0/3.
