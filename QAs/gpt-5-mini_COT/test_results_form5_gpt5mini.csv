Chapter 1_Q1.png,"No. The pizza with diameter of 30 cm is more
worth it.",,Variation,English,yes,4,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: Three circles (pizzas) showing diameters and prices — a geometric size/price comparison.
- Extracted key features:
  - Small pizza: diameter = 15 cm, price = RM12.
  - Medium pizza: diameter = 23 cm, price = RM25.
  - Large pizza: diameter = 30 cm, price = RM35.
- Relevant formula: surface area of a circular pizza A = πr^2 = π(d/2)^2.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Explicit goal: Determine whether the price RMp varies directly (is proportional) to the surface area A of the pizza. If not proportional, decide which pizza size gives the best value (i.e., the most area per ringgit or the lowest price per cm^2).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- For each pizza compute area A = π(d/2)^2.
- Compute price per unit area (price ÷ area) for each pizza: k = p / A.
- If k is the same for all three pizzas, then price varies directly with area. If k differs, it does not.
- The best buy is the pizza with the smallest k (lowest RM per cm^2).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.

1) Small pizza (d = 15 cm, p = RM12)
- radius r1 = 15/2 = 7.5 cm.
- area A1 = π·(7.5)^2 = π·56.25 = 56.25π ≈ 56.25 × 3.14159265 = 176.7146 cm^2.
- price per cm^2: k1 = 12 / 176.7146 ≈ 0.06793 RM/cm^2 (≈ 6.79 cents/cm^2).

2) Medium pizza (d = 23 cm, p = RM25)
- radius r2 = 23/2 = 11.5 cm.
- area A2 = π·(11.5)^2 = π·132.25 = 132.25π ≈ 132.25 × 3.14159265 = 415.4750 cm^2.
- price per cm^2: k2 = 25 / 415.4750 ≈ 0.06017 RM/cm^2 (≈ 6.02 cents/cm^2).

3) Large pizza (d = 30 cm, p = RM35)
- radius r3 = 30/2 = 15 cm.
- area A3 = π·(15)^2 = π·225 = 225π ≈ 225 × 3.14159265 = 706.8583 cm^2.
- price per cm^2: k3 = 35 / 706.8583 ≈ 0.04956 RM/cm^2 (≈ 4.96 cents/cm^2).

Comparison:
- k1 ≈ 0.06793, k2 ≈ 0.06017, k3 ≈ 0.04956 (RM per cm^2).
- These k values are not equal, so price is not directly proportional to surface area.

Step 5: Final Answer.
- No — the price does not vary directly as the surface area (the price per cm^2 differs for the three sizes).
- Best value: the 30 cm (large) pizza is worth buying because it has the lowest price per cm^2 (about RM0.0496 per cm^2).",1848,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
Chapter 1_Q2.png,7 cm,,Variation,English,yes,3,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: A geometry/variation word problem showing two semicircles (illustrative).
- Key features extracted:
  - The area L (cm^2) of a semicircle varies directly as the square of its diameter d (cm). So L ∝ d^2.
  - Given data point: when d = 2.8 cm, L = 3.08 cm^2.
  - Target: find d when L = 19.25 cm^2.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- The explicit goal: determine the diameter d (in cm) that gives area L = 19.25 cm^2 under the direct-variation law L = k d^2.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Use the direct-variation model L = k d^2 for some constant k.
- Use the given point to find k: 3.08 = k (2.8)^2.
- Then solve for d from 19.25 = k d^2.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Find k:
   3.08 = k × (2.8)^2
   (2.8)^2 = 7.84
   k = 3.08 / 7.84
   Multiply numerator and denominator by 100: k = 308 / 784
   Reduce fraction: divide both by 4 → 77 / 196
   Further divide by 7 → 11 / 28
   So k = 11/28 ≈ 0.392857...

2) Solve for d when L = 19.25:
   19.25 = (11/28) d^2
   Multiply both sides by 28/11: d^2 = 19.25 × (28/11)
   Compute numerator: 19.25 × 28 = (19.25 × 20) + (19.25 × 8) = 385 + 154 = 539
   So d^2 = 539 / 11
   Note 11 × 49 = 539, so d^2 = 49
   Therefore d = √49 = 7 cm (take the positive root for a diameter).

Step 5: Final Answer.
- The required diameter is d = 7 cm.",1404,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
Chapter 1_Q3.png,"(a) 154 cm2
(b) The area of the curved surface will
decrease.",,Variation,English,yes,3,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: geometric diagram of a right circular cone showing the slant height and base radius.
- Key features extracted:
  - Curved surface area A (cm^2) varies directly as radius r (cm) and slant height s (cm).
  - Relationship: A = k r s for some constant k.
  - Given data point: A = 88 when r = 3.5 and s = 8.
  - Target data for (a): r = 5, s = 9.8.
  - (b) asks about the change in A if s decreases while r is fixed (no numerical decrease specified).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- (a) Find A when r = 5 and s = 9.8 using the direct-variation relation.
- (b) Describe how the curved surface area changes when the slant height decreases while the base radius is fixed; give the formula for the change.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- A = k r s.
- Use given values to find k: k = A / (r s) = 88 / (3.5 × 8).
- Then compute A for r = 5, s = 9.8: A = k × 5 × 9.8.
- For (b), with r fixed, change in area ΔA corresponding to a change in slant height Δs is ΔA = k r Δs. (If Δs < 0, A decreases.)

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Find k:
   k = 88 / (3.5 × 8)
     = 88 / 28
     = 22 / 7.

2) Compute A for r = 5 and s = 9.8:
   A = (22/7) × 5 × 9.8.
   Note 9.8 = 49/5, so
   A = (22/7) × 5 × (49/5) = (22/7) × 49 = 22 × 7 = 154.
   So A = 154 cm^2.

3) Change in area when s changes while r is fixed:
   A = k r s, so ΔA = k r Δs.
   Using k = 22/7, ΔA = (22/7) r Δs.
   If Δs is negative (s decreases), ΔA is negative and the area decreases by |(22/7) r Δs|. The percentage change in A equals the percentage change in s (since A ∝ s when r fixed).

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) A = 154 cm^2.
- (b) With r fixed, the curved surface area changes in direct proportion to the change in slant height. The change in area is ΔA = k r Δs. Using the found k, ΔA = (22/7) r Δs. If s decreases by Δs (negative), the area decreases by (22/7) r |Δs|.",1820,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- Type of diagram: a table giving nutrient values for two drinks; this leads to a 2×2 linear system (system of linear equations / small matrix problem).
- Key features extracted from the table:
  - Let x = number of glasses of Drink P.
  - Let y = number of glasses of Drink Q.
  - Protein per glass: P gives 6 g, Q gives 4 g.
  - Calories per glass: P gives 95 kcal, Q gives 110 kcal.

  A = [[6, 4],
       [95,110]],
  v = [x, y]^T,
  b = [16, 300]^T.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation (matrix inverse method).
1. Compute determinant of A:
   det(A) = 6*110 - 95*4 = 660 - 380 = 280.

2. Compute adjugate (classical adjoint) of A:
   adj(A) = [[110, -4],
             [-95, 6]].

3. Inverse of A:
   A^-1 = (1/det(A)) * adj(A) = (1/280) * [[110, -4], [-95, 6]].

4. Multiply A^-1 by b to get v:
   v = A^-1 * b = (1/280) * [[110, -4], [-95, 6]] * [16, 300]^T.

   Compute the product inside:
   - First component: 110*16 + (-4)*300 = 1760 - 1200 = 560.
   - Second component: -95*16 + 6*300 = -1520 + 1800 = 280.

   Now multiply by 1/280:
   x = 560 / 280 = 2.
   y = 280 / 280 = 1.

Step 5: Final Answer.

- Face value given in the question: RM120 000.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal:
  (a) Calculate the annual premium for a 29-year-old man who smokes and for a 29-year-old man who does not smoke.
  (b) Calculate the annual premium for a 30-year-old woman who smokes and for a 30-year-old woman who does not smoke.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Number of RM1 000 units in the face value = 120 000 / 1 000 = 120.
- General formula: Premium = (face value / 1 000) × rate per RM1 000 = 120 × rate.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) 29-year-old man:
- Smoker: rate = 2.75 RM per RM1 000.
  Premium = 120 × 2.75
          = 120 × (2.00 + 0.75)
          = 120×2.00 + 120×0.75
          = 240.00 + 90.00
          = 330.00
  So premium = RM330.00.

- Non-smoker: rate = 2.12 RM per RM1 000.
  Premium = 120 × 2.12
          = 120 × (2.00 + 0.12)
          = 120×2.00 + 120×0.12
          = 240.00 + 14.40
          = 254.40
  So premium = RM254.40.

(b) 30-year-old woman:
- Smoker: rate = 1.46 RM per RM1 000.
  Premium = 120 × 1.46
          = 120 × (1.00 + 0.46)
          = 120×1.00 + 120×0.46
          = 120.00 + 55.20
          = 175.20

- (b)(i) For Vincent (45 years), find the annual premium for a 5‑year term with face value RM100 000.
- (b)(ii) For Vincent, if he instead buys a yearly renewable term with face value RM100 000, find the difference in his annual premium compared to the 5‑year term plan.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- General formula: Annual premium = (face value / 1 000) × rate.
- Monthly premium = Annual premium / 12.
- Difference in annual premium = Annual(5‑year) − Annual(yearly renewable).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a) Rizqi, 35 years, yearly renewable, face value RM150 000:
- Number of RM1 000 units = 150 000 / 1 000 = 150.
- Rate = RM4.03 per RM1 000.
- Annual premium = 150 × 4.03 = 150 × 4.03 = 604.50 (RM).
- Monthly premium = 604.50 / 12 = 50.375 → round to cents: RM50.38 per month.

(b)(i) Vincent, 45 years, 5‑year term, face value RM100 000:
- Number of RM1 000 units = 100 000 / 1 000 = 100.
- Rate = RM7.96 per RM1 000.
- Annual premium = 100 × 7.96 = RM796.00.

(b)(ii) Vincent, 45 years, yearly renewable, face value RM100 000:
- Rate = RM5.52 per RM1 000.
- Annual premium = 100 × 5.52 = RM552.00.
- Difference = 796.00 − 552.00 = RM244.00 (the 5‑year term costs RM244.00 more per year).

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) Rizqi’s monthly premium = RM50.38.
- (b)(i) Vincent’s annual premium for the 5‑year term = RM796.00.

- 2 001 cc – 2 500 cc: Base RM 380.00 + RM 1.00 for each cc exceeding 2 000 cc

Labeled items from the picture:
- Motorcycle engine capacity = 220 cc
- Car engine capacity = 1 860 cc

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Calculate the road tax for (a) the motorcycle with 220 cc, and (b) the private car with 1 860 cc, using the table rules.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- For the motorcycle: determine which band 220 cc falls into, then apply the corresponding base rate.
  - 220 cc ∈ [201, 250] so Road Tax = RM 50.00 (no progressive rate in that band).
- For the car: determine which band 1 860 cc falls into, then apply the base rate plus any progressive amount.
  - 1 860 cc ∈ [1 801, 2 000], so Road Tax = Base RM 280.00 + RM 0.50 × (cc exceeding 1 800).
  - Excess cc = 1 860 − 1 800 = 60 cc.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
- Motorcycle:
  - Band: 201–250 cc → Base RM 50.00
  - No progressive addition.
  - Road Tax (motorcycle) = RM 50.00

- Car:
  - Band: 1 801–2 000 cc → Base RM 280.00
  - Excess over 1 800 cc = 1 860 − 1 800 = 60 cc
  - Progressive charge = 60 × RM 0.50 = RM 30.00
  - Road Tax (car) = RM 280.00 + RM 30.00 = RM 310.00

- Type of diagram: A table listing the taxpayer’s income and allowable personal reliefs (i.e., a relief/expense schedule).
- Extracted data:
  - Annual salary (Encik Suhaimi): RM85,700 (year 2020).
  - Wife: no income.
  - Relief items and amounts shown:
    - Individual (self) relief: RM9,000
    - Life insurance and EPF (limited to RM7,000): amount shown RM7,760 (so subject to limit)
    - Lifestyle (limited to RM2,500): amount shown RM2,000
    - Spouse (tax relief for spouse who has no income): RM4,000
    - Medical treatment expenses for parents (limited to RM5,000): amount shown RM1,500

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Using joint tax assessment for the couple, calculate the total income tax payable for Encik Suhaimi and his wife for 2020.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Total assessable income (joint) = sum of incomes = RM85,700 + RM0 = RM85,700.
- Total allowable reliefs = sum of allowable amounts after applying statutory limits:
  - Individual relief = RM9,000
  - Life insurance & EPF = min(RM7,760, RM7,000) = RM7,000
  - Lifestyle = min(RM2,000, RM2,500 limit) = RM2,000
  - Spouse relief = RM4,000
  - Medical treatment for parents = min(RM1,500, RM5,000 limit) = RM1,500
- Chargeable income = Total assessable income − Total allowable reliefs.
- Income tax is computed using progressive resident individual tax rates (YA 2020). The brackets and rates used here:
  - RM0 – RM5,000: 0%
  - RM5,001 – RM20,000: 1%
  - RM20,001 – RM35,000: 3%
  - RM35,001 – RM50,000: 8%
  - RM50,001 – RM70,000: 14%
  (Only brackets up to the chargeable income are needed.)

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Compute allowed reliefs:
   - Individual = RM9,000
   - Life insurance & EPF = RM7,000 (limited)
   - Lifestyle = RM2,000
   - Spouse relief = RM4,000
   - Medical for parents = RM1,500
   - Total reliefs = 9,000 + 7,000 + 2,000 + 4,000 + 1,500 = RM23,500

2) Chargeable income:
   - Chargeable income = RM85,700 − RM23,500 = RM62,200

3) Compute tax on RM62,200 using the progressive rates:
   - On first RM5,000: 0% → 0
   - On next RM15,000 (RM5,001–RM20,000) at 1% → 15,000 × 1% = RM150
   - On next RM15,000 (RM20,001–RM35,000) at 3% → 15,000 × 3% = RM450
   - On next RM15,000 (RM35,001–RM50,000) at 8% → 15,000 × 8% = RM1,200
   - On remaining RM12,200 (RM50,001–RM62,200) at 14% → 12,200 × 14% = RM1,708.00
   - Total tax = 0 + 150 + 450 + 1,200 + 1,708 = RM3,508.00

- Key features extracted:
  - Centre O is common to both circles.
  - Radius of small circle r = 3 cm.
  - The large circle is an enlargement (centre O) of the small circle by scale factor k (so large radius R = k·r).
  - Coloured region is the annulus between the two circles; its area is given as 47.25π cm².

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Find the scale factor k of the enlargement (i.e., the ratio of the large radius to the small radius).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Area of annulus = area(large circle) − area(small circle) = πR² − πr² = π(R² − r²).
- Since R = k·r, R² = k²·r², so annulus area = π(k²·r² − r²) = π·r²·(k² − 1).
- Given annulus area = 47.25π, so:
  π·r²·(k² − 1) = 47.25π.
- Cancel π and substitute r = 3 cm (so r² = 9):
  9·(k² − 1) = 47.25.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) 9·(k² − 1) = 47.25

  - The tree is the object at distance u (object distance) from the pinhole. The image lies on the image plane on the opposite side of the pinhole at distance v from the pinhole.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Find the horizontal distance (in cm) between the tree (object) and its image (on the image plane).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- For a pinhole camera, magnification m = (image height)/(object height) = − (image distance)/(object distance) = −v/u.
- Given m = −1/80 and v = 15 cm, solve for u, then compute the distance between tree and image, which is u + v.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

   −1/80 = −v/u
2) Cancel negatives and substitute v = 15:
   1/80 = v/u = 15/u

- Type of diagram: Trapezium-shaped piece of land (a trapezoid).
- Extracted features from the diagram:
  - Top base length AB = 80 m (arrow on top).
  - Bottom base length CD = 320 m (arrow on bottom).
  - Left side AD is vertical and height = 200 m (right-angle marks at top-left and bottom-left).
  - Right side BC is slanted (non‑vertical).
  - Two interior dashed lines are perpendicular to the bases (right-angle marks where they meet top and bottom), so the trapezoid is divided by vertical cuts into three congruent sections (each section is a trapezoid with the same top and bottom segment lengths and the same height).
- Consequences:
  - Each of the three congruent sections has height 200 m.
  - Each section’s top segment length = 80/3 m and bottom segment length = 320/3 m.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Compute the perimeter (in m) of the whole trapezium.
- (b) Compute the area (in m^2) of each of the three congruent sections.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Perimeter P of trapezoid = top + bottom + left side + right slanted side.
  - top = 80, bottom = 320, left side = 200.
  - right slanted side length = sqrt((horizontal offset between bases)^2 + (height)^2).
    Horizontal offset = bottom − top = 320 − 80 = 240.
    So right side length = sqrt(240^2 + 200^2).
- Area of whole trapezoid A_total = (1/2)*(top + bottom)*height.
  - Area of each congruent section = A_total / 3.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Right slanted side length:
   - horizontal offset = 320 − 80 = 240.
   - right side = sqrt(240^2 + 200^2)
                = sqrt(57600 + 40000)
                = sqrt(97600)
                = sqrt(1600 * 61)
                = 40 * sqrt(61).
   - Decimal: 40 * sqrt(61) ≈ 40 * 7.8102497 ≈ 312.40999 m.

2) Perimeter P:
   - P = top + bottom + left + right
       = 80 + 320 + 200 + 40*sqrt(61)
       = 600 + 40*sqrt(61) m.
   - Decimal approximation: P ≈ 600 + 312.41 ≈ 912.41 m (rounded to two decimals).

3) Area of whole trapezoid:
   - A_total = (1/2) * (80 + 320) * 200
             = (1/2) * 400 * 200

- Type of diagram: Right-triangle (piece of wood leaning against a vertical wall).
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Hypotenuse (length of the wood) = 8 m.
  - Horizontal distance (base, adjacent side to θ) = 6 m.
  - Angle θ is between the horizontal ground and the wood.
  - Vertical height (opposite side to θ) is not labeled numerically in the diagram.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Calculate the value of sin θ.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- In the right triangle, sin θ = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse).
- Opposite side (vertical height) can be found by Pythagoras: (opposite)^2 + (adjacent)^2 = (hypotenuse)^2.
- So opposite = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 − adjacent^2) = sqrt(8^2 − 6^2).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1. Compute the square values:
   - 8^2 = 64
   - 6^2 = 36
2. Opposite side = sqrt(64 − 36) = sqrt(28).
3. Simplify sqrt(28): sqrt(28) = sqrt(4·7) = 2·sqrt(7).
4. Now sin θ = (opposite) / (hypotenuse) = (2·sqrt(7)) / 8.
5. Simplify the fraction: (2·sqrt(7)) / 8 = sqrt(7) / 4.

- Type of diagram: Graph of a trigonometric function (y vs x) for 0° ≤ x ≤ 360°.
- Key features extracted from the graph:
  - The curve passes through (0°, 0), (180°, 0) and (360°, 0).
  - Maximum value y = 1 (top) and minimum y = −1 (bottom), so amplitude = 1 and midline y = 0.
  - One full cycle from 0° to 360°, so period = 360°.
  - The graph has the shape of the sine function (starts at 0, rises to +1, crosses 0 at 180°, goes to −1, returns to 0 at 360°).
  - A marked point (m, 0.5) lies on the rising part of the first quadrant (between 0° and 90°).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Write the trigonometric function shown by the graph.
- (b) State the value of m (the x-value for which y = 0.5 at the shown point).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- A general sinusoid: y = A sin(Bx + C) + D.
- From the diagram: amplitude A = 1, midline D = 0, period 360° ⇒ B = 360°/period = 360°/360° = 1 (so argument in degrees simply x), and no horizontal shift C = 0. Thus y = sin x.
- For m: solve sin m = 0.5 with 0° ≤ m ≤ 360°. General solutions in [0°,360°] are m = 30° and m = 150°. The marked point is on the rising branch in the first quadrant (between 0° and 90°), so choose m = 30°.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Identify the function: from the intercepts, amplitude and period we set y = sin x.
2. Solve sin m = 0.5:
   - Known exact values: sin 30° = 0.5 and sin 150° = 0.5.
   - So m ∈ {30°, 150°} within [0°,360°].
3. Use the point location: the plotted point (m, 0.5) is on the rising part in the first quadrant (0° < m < 90°), so m = 30°.

  - Original position is the rightmost point on the circle: (5, 0).
  - The field boundary is a vertical line to the right of the circle such that the original position is 9 m from the boundary. Thus the boundary has x-coordinate 5 + 9 = 14, i.e. the line x = 14.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- New position coordinates: x_new = 5 cos 300°, y_new = 5 sin 300°.
- Shortest distance from a point (x_new, y_new) to the vertical line x = 14 is the perpendicular (horizontal) distance |14 − x_new|.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Compute cos 300° and sin 300°:
   - cos 300° = cos(360° − 60°) = cos 60° = 1/2.
   - sin 300° = sin(360° − 60°) = −sin 60° = −√3/2.

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) The distribution is not symmetrical. It is negatively skewed (skewed left): the bulk of observations lie at the higher glucose values (around 7–8 mmol/L) with a longer tail toward the lower values. (Also the median/bin center ≈ 7.45 is greater than the mean ≈ 7.18.)
- (b) Mean ≈ 7.18 mmol/L. Standard deviation ≈ 1.10 mmol/L.
- (c) For readings between 6.0 and 8.9 mmol/L (using the whole bins covering that range) the standard deviation ≈ 0.79 mmol/L, which is smaller than the overall standard deviation (1.10 mmol/L). Justification: restricting to the narrower range (exclude the lower extreme values) reduces the spread of the data, so the standard deviation decreases.",6000,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- Mean after taking the medicine = 142.0 mmHg
- Standard deviation after ≈ 13.42 mmHg (≈ 13.69 mmHg if using sample correction)

Is the medicine effective?
- Yes. The group mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 151.6 mmHg to 142.0 mmHg, a reduction of 9.6 mmHg. The standard deviation also decreased slightly, indicating a modest reduction in spread. This drop in average blood pressure provides evidence that the medicine lowered the group’s blood pressure (no formal hypothesis test was requested; this conclusion is based on the observed decrease in mean).",3331,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- Type of diagram: Graph of a parabolic arc (main cable) above a horizontal deck (so a parabola symmetric about the midpoint).
- Extracted key features from the diagram:
  - Horizontal span between the two towers (distance along the deck) = 600 m.
  - The deck is taken as the horizontal reference line (y measured above the deck).
  - The shortest distance from the main cable to the deck (the parabola’s vertex height) = 5 m (this occurs at the midpoint of the span).
  - Tower top (where the cable is attached) is 35 m above the deck at each end of the 600 m span.
  - Therefore the endpoints of the parabola (where it meets tower tops) are at x = ±300 m from the midpoint and y = 35 m.
  - Labeled points used: vertex (0, 5) and endpoints (300, 35) and (−300, 35).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Part (a): Determine the function y(x) that models the arc of the main cable (y measured in metres above the deck, x in metres from the midpoint).
- Part (b): If suspender cables (verticals from cable to deck) are spaced 20 m apart along the deck, determine how many suspender cables are needed on both sides of the bridge (i.e., total for the two main cables/sides).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Model the cable as a parabola symmetric about x = 0 with vertex at (0, 5): y = ax^2 + 5.
- Use the endpoint condition at x = 300: y(300) = 35 to find a.
- For number of suspenders: the deck length is 600 m; suspenders spaced every 20 m along that length. Positions from −300 to +300 inclusive spaced by 20 m.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a) Find a:
- y = ax^2 + 5.
- At x = 300, y = 35, so 35 = a(300)^2 + 5.
- 35 − 5 = a · 90,000 → 30 = 90,000 a.
- a = 30 / 90,000 = 1 / 3,000.
- Thus the parabola is y(x) = (1/3000) x^2 + 5. (Units: metres.)

(b) Number of suspenders:
- Spacing = 20 m over total span 600 m.
- Number of intervals = 600 / 20 = 30 intervals.
- Number of discrete positions (including both endpoints) = intervals + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31 suspenders along one main cable (i.e., along the length from one tower top to the other, including both ends).
- There are two main cables (one on each side of the deck), so total suspenders = 2 × 31 = 62.

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) The main cable is modeled by y(x) = (1/3000) x^2 + 5, with x in metres measured from the midpoint of the bridge and y the height above the deck in metres.
- (b) With suspenders 20 m apart there are 31 suspenders per main cable (along the span), and 62 suspenders in total for both sides of the bridge.",2427,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

  - Curve C is a straight line decreasing roughly linearly from 200 at t=0 down through zero near t≈192 s and well below zero by t=250 s.
  - Curve B decreases and then levels off, approaching a horizontal asymptote above 0 (looks like an exponential decay to a positive ambient temperature).
  - Curve A decreases initially then reaches a minimum and increases for larger t (a U-shaped behaviour consistent with an upward-opening parabola).
- Intercepts and basic fits observed:
  - For C (straight line through (0,200) and (120,75)) the slope ≈ (75−200)/120 = −125/120 = −1.0416667 °C/s and intercept 200.
  - B shows a horizontal asymptote (ambient temperature) >0.
  - A shows a parabola with a minimum around t≈150–170 s.

(b) Decide which model best describes the temperature for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s and explain why the other models do not fit well.

  Use points (0,200) and (120,75) to find m,c.
- Quadratic model form: T(t) = a t^2 + b t + c.
  Use three data points (0,200), (80,100), (120,75) to determine a,b,c and analyze shape (sign of a and vertex).
- Exponential (Newton cooling) form: T(t) = T_env + (T0 − T_env) e^{-k t}, where T0 = 200 at t=0, T_env is ambient temperature, k>0. Use data at t=40 and t=120 to estimate T_env and k and check fit.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Linear model (candidate C)
- Using (0,200) gives intercept c = 200.
- Slope m = (75 − 200) / (120 − 0) = −125 / 120 = −1.0416667 °C/s.
- Linear equation: T(t) = 200 − 1.0416667 t.
- Zero crossing: solve 200 − 1.0416667 t = 0 ⇒ t = 200 / 1.0416667 = 192 s.
- Value at t = 250: T(250) = 200 − 1.0416667·250 = 200 − 260.4167 = −60.4167 °C (physically unrealistic for cooling to room temperature).

Quadratic model (candidate A)
- Let T(t) = a t^2 + b t + c. From (0,200) ⇒ c = 200.
- From (80,100): 6400 a + 80 b + 200 = 100 ⇒ 6400 a + 80 b = −100.   (1)
- From (120,75): 14400 a + 120 b + 200 = 75 ⇒ 14400 a + 120 b = −125. (2)
- Multiply (1) by 1.5: 9600 a + 120 b = −150. Subtract from (2): (14400−9600)a = 4800 a = 25 ⇒ a = 25/4800 = 0.0052083333.
- Then from (1): 6400(0.0052083333) + 80 b = −100 ⇒ 33.333333 + 80 b = −100 ⇒ 80 b = −133.333333 ⇒ b = −1.6666667.
- Quadratic: T(t) = 0.0052083333 t^2 − 1.6666667 t + 200.
- Since a > 0, parabola opens upward. Vertex time t_vertex = −b/(2a) = 1.6666667 / (2·0.0052083333) = 160 s.
- Minimum temperature at vertex: T(160) = 0.0052083333·25600 −1.6666667·160 + 200 = 66.6667 °C.
- Value at t = 250: T(250) = 0.0052083333·62500 −1.6666667·250 + 200 = 108.3333 °C (quadratic predicts temperature rises back up to ≈108 °C by t=250).

Exponential model (candidate B)
- Use form T(t) = T_env + (200 − T_env) e^{-k t}. Let T_env = L.
- From t=40: 140 = L + (200 − L) e^{-40 k}.   (A)
- From t=120: 75 = L + (200 − L) e^{-120 k}.  (B)
- Divide (B−L) by (A−L): (75 − L)/(140 − L) = e^{-80 k} ⇒ k = −(1/80) ln[(75 − L)/(140 − L)].
- Solve for L numerically by matching (B) using (A)-derived e^{-40k}. Trial/iteration:
  - Try L = 26°C: then (140−26)/(200−26) = 114/174 = 0.65517 ⇒ e^{-40k} = 0.65517 ⇒ k = −ln(0.65517)/40 = 0.01058 s^{-1}.
    Then predicted T(120) = 26 + 174·(0.65517)^3 = 26 + 174·0.2812 = 26 + 48.95 = 74.95 ≈ 75 (very close).
- So an exponential fit is approximately: T(t) ≈ 26 + 174 e^{-0.01058 t}.
- Check long-time behaviour: T(t) → 26°C as t→∞ (approaches a positive ambient temperature). Predicted T(250) ≈ 26 + 174 e^{-2.645} ≈ 26 + 174·0.0711 ≈ 38.4 °C.

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) Identification of models:
- C is the linear model (straight line).
- A is the quadratic model (parabolic: decreases then increases).
- B is the exponential model (decays and levels off toward a positive horizontal asymptote).

(b) Best model for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s and why:
- The exponential model B best describes the cooling for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s. It fits the physics of cooling (Newton’s law of cooling) and fits the data without predicting nonphysical behavior: it decreases from 200°C and approaches a positive ambient temperature (≈26°C from the fit).
- The linear model C is not appropriate because it predicts temperature crossing zero around t ≈ 192 s and large negative temperatures by t = 250 s, which is physically unrealistic for ordinary cooling to room temperature.
- The quadratic model A is not appropriate over the full range because it opens upward (a > 0) and predicts the temperature reaches a minimum (~66.7°C at t = 160 s) then rises again to over 100°C by t = 250 s — implying spontaneous reheating, which is not consistent with the cooling process.

Therefore: C = linear, A = quadratic, B = exponential; and B (exponential) is the best model for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s because it matches both the data trend and the expected physical behaviour (monotone decay to a positive ambient temperature).",5296,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
