- Type of diagram: rectangular area problem (a rectangle with labeled length and width).
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Length = (x + 20) m
  - Width  = (x + 5) m
  - Area A (in m^2) is the product of length and width.
- No other points or numbers on the diagram.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Part (a) asks: write a function for the area A (in m^2) of the land in terms of x.
- Part (b) asks: if the area equals 250 m^2, write the resulting quadratic equation in x in the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Area function: A(x) = (length)(width) = (x + 20)(x + 5).
- When A = 250, set (x + 20)(x + 5) = 250 and rearrange to get a quadratic equation equal to 0.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Form the area function:
   A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5).

2) Expand the product:
   (x + 20)(x + 5) = x·x + x·5 + 20·x + 20·5
                    = x^2 + 5x + 20x + 100
                    = x^2 + 25x + 100.

3) For part (b), set the area equal to 250:
   x^2 + 25x + 100 = 250.

4) Subtract 250 from both sides to obtain standard quadratic form:
   x^2 + 25x + 100 − 250 = 0
   x^2 + 25x − 150 = 0.

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) Area function: A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5) = x^2 + 25x + 100 (m^2).
- (b) Quadratic equation when area = 250 m^2: x^2 + 25x − 150 = 0 (so a = 1, b = 25, c = −150).",1798,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- Type of diagram: Graph of a quadratic function (parabola).
- Given function: f(x) = −x^2 + 6x − 5.
- Visible features extracted from the diagram:
  - A horizontal line AB is shown (parallel to the x-axis) and meets the parabola at A and B.
  - Point A lies on the y-axis where the parabola meets that horizontal line.
  - The dashed horizontal line through A and B appears below the x-axis.
  - The vertex (maximum) point P is at the top of the parabola.
- Useful algebraic features (from f(x)):
  - y-intercept: f(0) = −5, so the parabola passes through (0, −5).
  - x-intercepts (for completeness): solve −x^2 + 6x − 5 = 0 → x = 1 and x = 5, so (1,0) and (5,0).
  - Axis of symmetry is vertical through the vertex (to be found).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Determine:
  (a) coordinates of point A,
  (b) equation of the axis of symmetry,
  (c) coordinates of point B,
  (d) coordinates of the maximum point P (the vertex).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- A is where x = 0 so A = (0, f(0)).
- B is the other intersection of the horizontal line through A with the parabola; that horizontal line has y = f(0) = −5, so solve f(x) = −5 for x (besides x = 0).
- Axis of symmetry for a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c is x = −b/(2a). Here a = −1, b = 6.
- Vertex P has x-coordinate h = −b/(2a) and y-coordinate k = f(h).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Compute f(0):
   f(0) = −(0)^2 + 6·0 − 5 = −5.
   Thus A = (0, −5).

2. Find B by solving f(x) = −5:
   −x^2 + 6x − 5 = −5
   ⇒ −x^2 + 6x = 0
   ⇒ x(−x + 6) = 0
   Solutions: x = 0 or x = 6.
   x = 0 is point A, so the other intersection is x = 6.
   Thus B = (6, −5).

3. Axis of symmetry:
   x = −b/(2a) = −6/(2·(−1)) = −6/(−2) = 3.
   So the equation is x = 3.

4. Vertex P:
   h = 3. Compute k = f(3):
   f(3) = −(3)^2 + 6·3 − 5 = −9 + 18 − 5 = 4.
   Thus P = (3, 4).

(a) A = (0, −5)

- Type of diagram: Geometric shapes (an isosceles triangle and a square).
- Diagram 1 (isosceles triangle):
  - Base = 4y cm.
  - Height = (y + 5) cm (drawn to the midpoint of the base).
  - The two equal sides are congruent (isosceles).
  - Half of the base (from midpoint to one base end) = 2y cm.
- Diagram 2 (square):
  - Side length = y cm.
  - Perimeter = 4y, area = y^2.
- Given relation: Area(triangle) is 39 cm^2 more than Area(square).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Find the difference in perimeter between the triangle and the square (i.e. Perimeter(triangle) − Perimeter(square)).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Area of triangle = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 4y × (y + 5) = 2y(y + 5).
- Area of square = y^2.
- Given: Area(triangle) − Area(square) = 39, so 2y(y + 5) − y^2 = 39.
- Perimeter(triangle) = base + 2 × equal side. Equal side length s = sqrt((half base)^2 + height^2) = sqrt((2y)^2 + (y+5)^2).
- Perimeter(square) = 4y.
- Desired: Perimeter(triangle) − 4y.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Solve the area equation:
   2y(y + 5) − y^2 = 39
   Expand: 2y^2 + 10y − y^2 = 39
   Simplify: y^2 + 10y − 39 = 0

   sqrt(D) = 16
   y = [−10 ± 16] / 2
   Possible y = (6)/2 = 3 or y = (−26)/2 = −13. Discard negative length, so y = 3 cm.

2) Compute dimensions:
   Base = 4y = 12 cm.
   Half base = 2y = 6 cm.
   Height = y + 5 = 8 cm.
   Equal side s = sqrt(6^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10 cm.

3) Perimeters:
   Perimeter(triangle) = base + 2s = 12 + 2·10 = 12 + 20 = 32 cm.
   Perimeter(square) = 4y = 4·3 = 12 cm.

- Type of diagram: A simple list of four numerals (not a graph or chart).
- Extracted items (the four numbers shown): 234, 673, 336, 281.
- Key feature for this problem: validity of a numeral in base b depends on each digit being an integer 0,1,...,b−1 (i.e., every digit must be strictly less than the base).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: For each given base (a) 5, (b) 7, (c) 8, (d) 9, identify which of the four listed numbers are valid numerals in that base.

- Type of diagram: word problem with a small illustrative picture (not mathematical graph).
- Key features extracted from the diagram/text:
  - Total number of visitors in January is 20202 (base 5), written 20202_5.
  - Zoo is open every day in January.
  - January has 31 days.
  - We must give the average number of visitors per day in base five.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Compute the average visitors per day = (total visitors) ÷ 31, and express that average in base five.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Let N be the total in decimal. First convert 20202_5 to decimal:
  N = 2·5^4 + 0·5^3 + 2·5^2 + 0·5^1 + 2·5^0.
- Average (decimal) = N / 31.
- Finally convert that average back to base 5.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Convert 20202_5 to decimal:
   5^4 = 625, 5^2 = 25, 5^0 = 1.
   N = 2·625 + 0·125 + 2·25 + 0·5 + 2·1
     = 1250 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 2
     = 1302 (decimal).

2) Divide by 31:
   Average = 1302 / 31.
   Compute 31·40 = 1240, 31·2 = 62, so 31·42 = 1240 + 62 = 1302.
   Therefore 1302 / 31 = 42 (decimal).

3) Convert 42 (decimal) to base 5:
   42 ÷ 5 = 8 remainder 2  → least significant digit 2
   8 ÷ 5 = 1 remainder 3   → next digit 3
   1 ÷ 5 = 0 remainder 1   → most significant digit 1
   So 42_decimal = 132_5.

  - Rectangle with horizontal side 80 m (top side labeled 80 m).
  - Vertical side labeled x m (right side).
  - A diagonal from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.
  - The coloured section is the top-left triangle (children’s playground).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Find the area (in square metres) of the children’s playground (the coloured right triangle).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Perimeter of rectangle = 2(length + height) = 2(80 + x).
- The given perimeter 3300_4 must be converted to decimal.
- Area of the coloured triangle = (1/2) * (length) * (height) = (1/2) * 80 * x.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Convert 3300_4 to decimal:
   3300_4 = 3·4^3 + 3·4^2 + 0·4 + 0

- Type of diagram: semicircles arranged in a geometric (halving) pattern along a common diameter.
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - The largest semicircle has radius 32 cm.
  - Each subsequent semicircle has half the radius of the previous one (so radii form a geometric sequence 32, 16, 8, 4, ...).
  - Perimeter of a semicircle (used here) is the curved arc length plus the straight diameter: P = (π r) + (2 r) = r(π + 2).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- (a) Calculate and list the perimeters of the first four semicircles, in terms of π.
- (b) Show the general formula given in the question for the perimeters of the semicircles, which is stated as 2^{6-n}(π + 2) (the intended index starts at n = 1 for the largest semicircle; see note below).
- (c) Calculate the perimeter, in cm, of the 8th semicircle.

(Note on indexing: to match the diagram where the largest semicircle is the first term, it is natural to index semicircles by n = 1, 2, 3, ... . With that indexing r_n = 32*(1/2)^{n-1} = 2^{6-n}, so P_n = 2^{6-n}(π+2). If one used n starting at 0, the given formula would need adjustment. Below I use n = 1 for the largest semicircle.)

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Perimeter formula: P = r(π + 2).
- Radii sequence: r1 = 32, r2 = 32*(1/2) = 16, r3 = 32*(1/2)^2 = 8, r4 = 32*(1/2)^3 = 4, and in general r_n = 32*(1/2)^{n-1} = 2^{6-n}.
- Therefore general perimeter: P_n = r_n(π+2) = 2^{6-n}(π+2).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a) First four semicircles:
- For semicircle 1: r1 = 32, P1 = 32(π + 2) = 32π + 64.
- For semicircle 2: r2 = 16, P2 = 16(π + 2) = 16π + 32.
- For semicircle 3: r3 = 8,  P3 = 8(π + 2)  = 8π + 16.
- For semicircle 4: r4 = 4,  P4 = 4(π + 2)  = 4π + 8.

(b) Generalisation:
- From r_n = 32*(1/2)^{n-1} = 2^{5}*2^{-(n-1)} = 2^{6-n}, we obtain
  P_n = r_n(π + 2) = 2^{6-n}(π + 2), for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... .
- This matches the given general form when n is interpreted to start at 1 (if the problem statement lists n = 0,1,2,... that is a small indexing slip).

(c) Perimeter of the 8th semicircle:
- r8 = 32*(1/2)^{7} = 32/128 = 1/4 cm.

- Type of diagram: a simple sequence (number pattern) illustrated by boxes showing numbers of equal cylinders.
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Box 1 contains 3 cylinders.
  - Box 2 contains 5 cylinders.
  - Box 3 contains 7 cylinders.
  - Box 4 contains 9 cylinders.
- Observed pattern: the counts form the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, ... (consecutive odd numbers increasing by 2). Let n denote the box number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Part (a) asks for a conclusion by induction for the pattern of the number of cylinders in box n (i.e., find and prove a formula for the number in box n).
- Part (b) asks: given each cylinder has radius 14 cm and height 10 cm, calculate the total volume of the cylinders in box 8.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- From the pattern 3, 5, 7, 9, ... we conjecture the formula:
  Number of cylinders in box n = 2n + 1, for n ≥ 1.
- For part (b): number in box 8 = 2·8 + 1 = 17. Volume of one cylinder = π r^2 h. Total volume for box 8 = 17 · π · r^2 · h with r = 14 cm, h = 10 cm.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a) Proof by induction of P(n): ""Box n contains 2n + 1 cylinders.""
- Base case (n = 1): 2(1) + 1 = 3, and Box 1 indeed contains 3 cylinders. So P(1) is true.
- Induction hypothesis: assume for some k ≥ 1 that Box k contains 2k + 1 cylinders.
- Induction step: the diagram shows each successive box increases the count by 2. So
  Box (k+1) contains (Box k count) + 2 = (2k + 1) + 2 = 2k + 3 = 2(k+1) + 1.
  Thus P(k) ⇒ P(k+1). By induction, P(n) holds for all n ≥ 1. Conclusion: number in box n = 2n + 1.

(b) Compute total volume for box 8.
- Number of cylinders in box 8: n = 8 ⇒ N = 2·8 + 1 = 17.
- Volume of one cylinder: V1 = π r^2 h = π · (14 cm)^2 · (10 cm) = π · 196 · 10 = 1960 π cm^3.
- Total volume: Vtotal = 17 · V1 = 17 · 1960 π = 33320 π cm^3.

  - Q only: 4k
  - P ∩ R only (not Q): k
  - Q ∩ R only (not P): 5
  - P ∩ Q ∩ R (triple intersection): 1
  - Outside all three (ξ \ (P ∪ Q ∪ R)): 2k
- No other numbers shown (R-only region appears unlabeled, so assume 0).

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
- Goal: Determine n(ξ), the total number of elements in the universal set ξ.

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
- n(Q) is the total of regions inside Q:
  n(Q) = (Q only) + (P ∩ Q only) + (Q ∩ R only) + (triple)
       = 4k + 2 + 5 + 1 = 4k + 8.
- (P ∪ R)' (the complement of P ∪ R) consists of elements not in P and not in R, i.e. those in Q only and those outside all circles:
  n((P ∪ R)') = (Q only) + (outside all)
               = 4k + 2k = 6k.
- Given: n(Q) = n((P ∪ R)') ⇒ 4k + 8 = 6k.

Step 4 — Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Solve 4k + 8 = 6k:
   4k + 8 = 6k
   8 = 6k − 4k
   8 = 2k
   k = 4.
2. Compute each region with k = 4:
   - Q only = 4k = 16
   - P ∩ R only = k = 4
   - Outside all = 2k = 8
3. Sum all regions to get n(ξ):
   n(ξ) = P only + (P ∩ Q) + (Q only) + (P ∩ R) + (Q ∩ R) + (triple) + (outside)
         = 3 + 2 + 16 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 8

  - A ∩ B (but not C): y − 2
  - A ∩ C (but not B): 5

  - A ∩ B ∩ C (triple intersection): y − 1
- Given statement: the universal set ξ = A ∪ B ∪ C, and n(B′) = n(B ∩ C).
  (B′ denotes the complement of B within the universal set ξ.)

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Find the value of y.
- (b) Find n(A ∪ B ∪ C) (the total number of elements in the universal set).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Total number in the universal set S = n(A ∪ B ∪ C) is the sum of all seven regions:
  S = 2 + (y − 2) + 4 + 5 + 9 + 12 + (y − 1).
- Number in B is sum of regions that lie in B:
  n(B) = 4 + (y − 2) + 9 + (y − 1).
- Number not in B: n(B′) = S − n(B).
- Number in B ∩ C is the sum of the B∩C-only region and the triple region:
  n(B ∩ C) = 9 + (y − 1).
- Given equation: n(B′) = n(B ∩ C).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Compute S algebraically:
   S = 2 + (y − 2) + 4 + 5 + 9 + 12 + (y − 1)
     = (2 − 2) + 4 + 5 + 9 + 12 − 1 + y + y
     = 29 + 2y
   So S = 2y + 29.

2) Compute n(B):
   n(B) = 4 + (y − 2) + 9 + (y − 1)
        = (4 − 2 + 9 − 1) + 2y
        = 10 + 2y
   So n(B) = 2y + 10.

3) Compute n(B′):
   n(B′) = S − n(B) = (2y + 29) − (2y + 10) = 19.

   Note: n(B′) is independent of y (cancels out).

4) Compute n(B ∩ C):
   n(B ∩ C) = 9 + (y − 1) = y + 8.

5) Use given equality n(B′) = n(B ∩ C):
   19 = y + 8
   Solve for y:
     y = 19 − 8 = 11.

6) Now compute S with y = 11:
   S = 2y + 29 = 2(11) + 29 = 22 + 29 = 51.

- (a)(i) Find the most economical route from P to S (minimize total cost).
- (a)(ii) Find the route from P to S that takes the shortest total time (including flight times and transit times).

- Consider all directed routes from P to S allowed by the graph:
  1) P -> S
  2) P -> Q -> S
  3) P -> R -> S
  4) P -> Q -> R -> S
- For each route compute:

  - Total time = sum of edge flight times + 0.75 h for each transit airport encountered (Q and/or R as intermediate nodes).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

  - DE: 650 m (arrow from D down to E).
  - BE: 1.1 km = 1100 m (arrow from B left to E).
- Additional information: BE is a municipal road; AB, AC, CD, DE are roads in the housing estates.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Suggest the best route for Lani to cycle from A to E and justify the choice. Implicitly this means choose the shortest and/or safest route consistent with the road types given.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Consider all directed paths from A to E following the arrows.
- Possible directed routes from A to E:
  1) A → B → E
  2) A → C → D → E
- Compute total lengths of each route and compare. Prefer the route with smaller total distance and, given road-type info, prefer a route that uses the municipal road BE (safer/smoother for cycling).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
- Convert 1.1 km to metres: 1.1 km = 1100 m.
- Route 1 (A → B → E):
  - Length = AB + BE = 400 m + 1100 m
  - Length = 1500 m
  - In kilometres: 1500 m = 1.5 km

  - Length = 1800 m
  - In kilometres: 1800 m = 1.8 km
- Comparison:
  - Route 1 = 1500 m; Route 2 = 1800 m.
  - Route 1 is 300 m shorter than Route 2.
- Road-type consideration:
  - Route 1 uses BE (municipal road) and AB (housing estate).
  - Route 2 uses AC, CD, DE (all housing-estate roads).
  - Municipal road BE is likely smoother/safer for cycling than housing-estate roads, so route 1 is preferable on non-distance grounds as well.

- Best route: A → B → E.
- Justification: A → B → E has total length 1500 m (1.5 km), which is shorter than the alternative A → C → D → E (1800 m). Additionally, A → B → E uses the municipal road BE (safer/smoother for cycling), so it is both the shortest and the preferable route.",2100,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

  - Right oblique line passes through (0,4) and (3,0).
  - The x-axis y = 0 is the base; the shaded region is the triangle above the x-axis and below the two oblique lines.

(c)
- Type: Graph (region bounded by the y-axis and two oblique lines).
- Key visible features (from the picture’s labeled intercepts):
  - Two oblique (magenta) lines with y-intercepts at y = -1 (upper) and y = -2 (lower).
  - The upper line passes through (0,-1) and the x-axis at x = 1 (so (1,0) is on the upper line).
  - The lower line passes through (0,-2) and the x-axis at x = 3 (so (3,0) is on the lower line).
  - The shaded region is to the right of the y-axis (x ≥ 0) and between the two oblique lines.

Step 2: Question Interpretation

For each diagram (a), (b), (c) write a system of inequalities whose solution set is exactly the shaded region.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

(a) Find equation of the oblique line through (-4,2) and (4,0).
- Slope m = (0 − 2)/(4 − (−4)) = −2/8 = −1/4.
- Line: y = (−1/4)x + b. Use (4,0): 0 = (−1/4)·4 + b ⇒ 0 = −1 + b ⇒ b = 1.
- Line equation: y = −(1/4)x + 1.
Boundaries:
- vertical boundary: x = −4, interior is to the right ⇒ x ≥ −4
- x-axis: y = 0, interior is above ⇒ y ≥ 0
- oblique line: interior is below that line ⇒ y ≤ −(1/4)x + 1

(b) Left oblique line through (−2,0) and (0,4):
- Slope m_left = (4 − 0)/(0 − (−2)) = 4/2 = 2.
- Equation: y = 2x + 4 (check: at x = −2 gives y = 0; at x = 0 gives y = 4).
Right oblique line through (0,4) and (3,0):
- Slope m_right = (0 − 4)/(3 − 0) = −4/3.
- Equation: y = −(4/3)x + 4.
Boundaries:
- x-axis: y = 0, interior is above ⇒ y ≥ 0
- interior is below both oblique sides ⇒ y ≤ 2x + 4 and y ≤ −(4/3)x + 4
(Optionally restrict domain −2 ≤ x ≤ 3, but the three inequalities above already confine the region.)

(c) Using the labeled intercepts:
- Upper line passes through (0, −1) and (1, 0). Slope = (0 − (−1))/(1 − 0) = 1. Equation: y = x − 1.
- Lower line passes through (0, −2) and (3, 0). Slope = (0 − (−2))/(3 − 0) = 2/3. Equation: y = (2/3)x − 2.
Boundaries:
- left boundary: the y-axis x = 0, interior is to the right ⇒ x ≥ 0
- interior is between the two lines, i.e. greater than or equal to the lower line and less than or equal to the upper line:
  (2/3)x − 2 ≤ y ≤ x − 1
(Optionally restrict 0 ≤ x ≤ 3; with the two line inequalities and x ≥ 0 the shaded strip is correctly described.)

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(a)
1. Compute slope from points (−4,2) and (4,0):
   m = (0 − 2)/(4 − (−4)) = −2/8 = −1/4.
2. Line through (4,0): 0 = (−1/4)·4 + b ⇒ b = 1.
3. Line equation: y = −(1/4)x + 1.
4. Region is: to the right of x = −4, above y = 0, and below the line.

2. Lower line through (0,−2) and (3,0): slope = 2/3 ⇒ y = (2/3)x − 2.
3. Region is to the right of the y-axis and between the two lines.

Type of diagram:
- Both (a) and (b) are linear-inequality (graphical) regions on an x–y grid.

What I can read directly from the images:

(a)
- There is a diagonal magenta line passing through the point labeled (3, 3). It looks like the line y = x (slope 1 through the origin), but from the low resolution of the image I cannot be 100% certain of its y-intercept.
- A vertical dashed line is drawn at x = 3.
- A point is labeled (3, −2) on that vertical dashed line.
- The shaded region is a roughly rectangular/trapezoidal region that lies to the right of a slanted boundary near the origin (the magenta line), and has a lower y-value marked −2 (the point (3, −2) is on the lower boundary). The left part of the shaded region touches or includes the origin O and extends leftwards to about x = −2 (there is a “−2” shown near the left bottom).
- Because the image is small/low resolution, the exact coordinates of the left and top boundaries (and whether the slanted boundary is exactly y = x or a parallel line) are ambiguous from this scan.

(b)
- The shaded region is a triangle with vertices at the labeled points O (the origin, (0,0)), (2, 4), and (4, 2).
- The three boundary lines are:
  1) The line through (0,0) and (2,4): slope 4/2 = 2, equation y = 2x.
  2) The line through (0,0) and (4,2): slope 2/4 = 1/2, equation y = (1/2) x.
  3) The line through (2,4) and (4,2): slope (2 − 4)/(4 − 2) = −1, equation y = −x + 6 (check: at x = 4, y = −4 + 6 = 2, at x = 2, y = −2 + 6 = 4).
- The triangle is the region bounded by these three lines (the interior is between the two rays from the origin, and bounded above by y = −x + 6).

Step 2: Question Interpretation

- The explicit goal: For each part (a) and (b), write the linear inequalities that describe the image (the reflected shaded region) after reflecting the original shaded region across the x-axis.
- That means: given the original region R (described by inequalities in x and y), find inequalities describing R' = { (x, y) : (x, −y) ∈ R } (the set you get by reflecting every point (x,y) of R across the x-axis).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation

General rule for reflection in the x-axis:
- If the original region R is described by inequalities involving y, then for the reflected region R' substitute y -> −y in the original inequalities. Equivalently, a point (x, y) is in the reflected region iff (x, −y) satisfies the original inequalities.

(b) formulation (clear from the picture):
- Original triangle R is given by the intersection of:
  1) y ≤ 2x? (we must determine which side; test a point interior such as (2,2): for y = 2x at x = 2 gives 4; interior y = 2 is less than 4, so interior satisfies y ≤ 2x),
  2) y ≥ (1/2) x (test (2,2): 2 ≥ 1 yields true),
  3) y ≤ −x + 6 (test (2,2): 2 ≤ 4 true).
- So original R: y ≤ 2x, y ≥ (1/2) x, y ≤ −x + 6.
- For reflected region R' we replace y by −y in each inequality, then simplify signs to get inequalities in y:
  1) (−y) ≤ 2x  →  y ≥ −2x
  2) (−y) ≥ (1/2) x →  y ≤ −(1/2) x
  3) (−y) ≤ −x + 6 →  y ≥ x − 6

(a) formulation (ambiguous from the image):
- I can describe the procedure to follow, and I can list the likely candidate lines if the slanted line is indeed y = x:
  - If the magenta slanted line is y = x, and the region is bounded between that line and the horizontal line y = −2, and between some vertical lines x = a and x = 3 (where a looks like −2 in the picture), then the original region would be described by a system like:
    y ≥ ? or ≤ ? (depending on whether the shaded region is above or below the slanted line),
    y ≥ −2 or y ≤ −2,
    a ≤ x ≤ 3.
  - To reflect across the x-axis you would replace y with −y in those inequalities (so y ≤ 2 if original had y ≥ −2, etc.).
- Because the left/top boundary coordinates and whether the slanted boundary is exactly y = x are not completely unambiguous from the provided low-resolution image, I do not want to give a possibly incorrect list of inequalities for (a).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(b) Full step-by-step as requested:
1) Identify the three boundary lines of the original triangle with exact equations:
   - Line A (through (0,0) and (2,4)): slope = 2, equation y = 2x.
   - Line B (through (0,0) and (4,2)): slope = 1/2, equation y = (1/2)x.
   - Line C (through (2,4) and (4,2)): slope = −1, equation y = −x + 6.
2) Determine which side of each line contains the interior. Test a known interior point, for instance (2,2):
   - For y = 2x: at x = 2, y_line = 4. The interior point has y = 2, which is less than 4, so interior satisfies y ≤ 2x.
   - For y = (1/2)x: at x = 2, y_line = 1. The interior point has y = 2 ≥ 1, so interior satisfies y ≥ (1/2)x.
   - For y = −x + 6: at x = 2, y_line = 4. The interior point y = 2 ≤ 4, so interior satisfies y ≤ −x + 6.
3) So original triangle R inequalities:
   y ≤ 2x,
   y ≥ (1/2)x,
   y ≤ −x + 6.
4) Reflect across the x-axis: for every inequality, substitute y by −y (since reflected point (x,y) corresponds to original (x,−y)).
   - Substitute in y ≤ 2x: (−y) ≤ 2x → multiply by −1 (flip inequality): y ≥ −2x.
   - Substitute in y ≥ (1/2)x: (−y) ≥ (1/2)x → multiply by −1: y ≤ −(1/2)x.
   - Substitute in y ≤ −x + 6: (−y) ≤ −x + 6 → multiply by −1: y ≥ x − 6.
5) So the reflected triangle R' is the intersection of:
   y ≥ −2x,
   y ≤ −(1/2)x,
   y ≥ x − 6.

(a) Because the exact coordinates/lines for the shaded region in (a) are ambiguous in the supplied image, I will not assert an incorrect system. To complete part (a) I need one clarifying piece of information:
- Please confirm the exact bounding lines/coordinates for the original shaded region in (a). In particular:
  1) Is the slanted magenta line exactly y = x (i.e., slope 1 passing through the origin), or is it a different line? The point (3,3) is marked on it, which suggests y = x, but please confirm.
  2) What are the x-coordinates of the left and right vertical boundaries of the shaded region? From the picture I see a dashed vertical at x = 3 on the right and a mark near −2 on the left; are the horizontal limits x = −2 and x = 3?
  3) What is the top and bottom y-values of the shaded region? I see the lower labeled y-value −2 on the lower boundary (point (3, −2) is marked). Is the top of the shaded region at y = 0 (the x-axis) or at some positive value?
- If you can confirm those coordinates (or upload a higher-resolution crop of part (a)), I will produce the explicit inequalities for (a) with the same 5-step structure.

(b) Final inequalities for the reflected image (after reflection in the x-axis):

- y ≤ −(1/2) x
- y ≥ x − 6

- Type of diagram: Speed–time graph.
- Axes: vertical axis speed (m s–1), horizontal axis time (s).
- Key labeled points and values from the graph:
  - At t = 0 s, v = 0 m s–1 (origin).
  - At t = 40 s, v = 15 m s–1.
  - From t = 40 s to t = 120 s, speed is constant at v = 15 m s–1.
  - At t = 120 s, v = 15 m s–1.
  - At t = 150 s, v = 0 m s–1.
- Line segments:
  - Rising straight line from (0,0) to (40,15).
  - Horizontal line from (40,15) to (120,15).
  - Falling straight line from (120,15) to (150,0).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Find the rate of change of speed (acceleration) in m s–2 of the car for the first 20 seconds.
- (b) Calculate the distance, in metres, travelled at the uniform speed (the constant-speed portion).
- (c) Describe Encik Merisat’s journey over the period of 2.5 minutes (2.5 min = 150 s).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- (a) Acceleration a = Δv / Δt for the initial (0 to 20 s) period. Because the initial rise is linear, the acceleration is constant and equals (15 − 0)/(40 − 0).
- (b) Distance during the uniform-speed interval (40 s to 120 s) is d = v × Δt with v = 15 m s–1 and Δt = 120 − 40 = 80 s.
- (c) Describe motion piecewise for 0–150 s; compute deceleration during 120–150 s as a = (0 − 15)/(150 − 120).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) Acceleration for the first 20 s:
- Since the speed increases linearly from 0 to 15 m s–1 in 40 s, acceleration a = (15 − 0) / 40 = 15 / 40 = 0.375 m s–2.
- Check using the first 20 s: speed at 20 s = (20/40)×15 = 7.5 m s–1, so a = (7.5 − 0)/20 = 7.5/20 = 0.375 m s–2. (Same value.)

(b) Distance travelled at uniform speed:
- Duration of uniform speed = 120 − 40 = 80 s.
- Distance d = v × t = 15 m s–1 × 80 s = 1200 m.

(c) Description for 2.5 minutes (150 s) and deceleration:
- 0–40 s: car accelerates uniformly from rest to 15 m s–1 at a = 0.375 m s–2.
- 40–120 s: car travels at constant speed 15 m s–1 for 80 s.
- 120–150 s: car decelerates uniformly from 15 m s–1 to rest in 30 s. Deceleration = (0 − 15) / 30 = −0.5 m s–2 (magnitude 0.5 m s–2).
- (Optional total distance over 0–150 s by area under the graph: triangle (0–40): 0.5×40×15 = 300 m; rectangle (40–120): 80×15 = 1200 m; triangle (120–150): 0.5×30×15 = 225 m. Total = 300 + 1200 + 225 = 1725 m.)

- Type of diagram: Distance–time graph.
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Time axis: horizontal, in hours from 0 to 3.
  - Distance axis: vertical, in km from 0 to 150.
  - Tour bus (magenta) is a straight line from A(0,150) to B(3,0). Its distance function is D_bus(t) = 150 − 50 t (km).
  - Car (green) is piecewise linear:
    - First segment from O(0,0) to P(0.7,70). So at t = 0.7 h the car has travelled 70 km.
    - Second segment from P(0.7,70) to R(3,150). So the car covers the remaining 80 km between t = 0.7 and t = 3.
  - Labeled points:
    - P: (0.7, 70) on the car's first segment.
    - Q: the intersection of car and bus (same distance at time t), with time coordinate t (unknown).
    - Total distance travelled by each in 3 hours is 150 km (car ends at R(3,150), bus ends at B(3,0)).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- We must compute:
  (a) the car’s rate of change of distance (speed) during the first 24 minutes;
  (b) the value of t (the time when car and bus are at the same distance);
  (c) the car’s rate of change of distance for the last 80 km of its journey.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Convert 24 minutes to hours: 24 min = 24/60 = 0.4 h.
- (a) For the first segment (0 ≤ t ≤ 0.7), speed = (distance change)/(time change) = 70 km / 0.7 h.
- (b) For t > 0.7 the car’s distance is D_car(t) = 70 + s2*(t − 0.7), where s2 is the speed on the second segment. The bus distance is D_bus(t) = 150 − 50 t. At the meeting time t, D_car(t) = D_bus(t). Also s2 = (150 − 70) / (3 − 0.7) = 80 / 2.3 = 800/23 km/h.
- (c) The rate for the last 80 km is s2 = 80 / (3 − 0.7) = 800/23 km/h.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a) Speed during first 24 minutes (first segment):
- speed1 = 70 km / 0.7 h = 100 km/h.
- Since 0.4 h < 0.7 h, the car’s speed during the first 24 minutes is 100 km/h.

(b) Find t where car and bus meet (t > 0.7):
- Compute s2 exactly: s2 = 80 / (3 − 0.7) = 80 / 2.3 = 800/23 km/h.
- Car distance for t > 0.7: D_car(t) = 70 + (800/23)(t − 0.7).
- Bus distance: D_bus(t) = 150 − 50 t.
- Equate: 70 + (800/23)(t − 0.7) = 150 − 50 t.
- Expand left: 70 + (800/23) t − (800/23)*0.7 = 150 − 50 t.
  Compute (800/23)*0.7 = 560/23.
  Write 70 = 1610/23, so left constant = 1610/23 − 560/23 = 1050/23.
- Equation: (800/23) t + 1050/23 = 150 − 50 t.
- Multiply both sides by 23: 800 t + 1050 = 3450 − 1150 t.
- Bring t-terms together: 800 t + 1150 t = 3450 − 1050 → 1950 t = 2400.
- Solve: t = 2400 / 1950 = 48 / 39 = 16 / 13 hours.
- Decimal: t = 16/13 ≈ 1.230769... h.

(c) Rate for the last 80 km (second segment):
- s2 = 80 / (3 − 0.7) = 80 / 2.3 = 800/23 km/h ≈ 34.7826 km/h.

(a) 100 km h^−1.

  3) 10 → t s: trapezoid with parallel sides 4 and 10 and width (t−10): area = ((4+10)/2)*(t−10) = 7*(t−10).
- Total motorcycle distance = 4 + 32 + 7*(t−10) = 36 + 7t −70 = 7t −34.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- For each dataset (a) and (b) find:
  1) Range
  2) Interquartile range (IQR = Q3 − Q1)

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Range = maximum value − minimum value.
- For quartiles use the position formula: Q1 at (n+1)/4-th ordered observation, Q3 at 3(n+1)/4-th observation. The value at that position (as determined from cumulative frequencies) gives the quartile value.
- IQR = Q3 − Q1.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Part (a):
- n = 80.
- Range = max − min = 7.2 − 6.0 = 1.2 cm.

- Q1 position = (n+1)/4 = 81/4 = 20.25. Position 20.25 lies in the block 16–27 which corresponds to diameter 6.4. Therefore Q1 = 6.4 cm.
- Q3 position = 3(n+1)/4 = 3×81/4 = 243/4 = 60.75. Position 60.75 lies in the block 46–65 which corresponds to diameter 6.8. Therefore Q3 = 6.8 cm.
- IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 6.8 − 6.4 = 0.4 cm.

Part (b):
- n = 100.
- Range = max − min = 18 − 13 = 5 years.

- Q1 position = (n+1)/4 = 101/4 = 25.25. Position 25.25 lies in the block 13–30 which corresponds to age 14. Therefore Q1 = 14 years.
- Q3 position = 3(n+1)/4 = 3×101/4 = 303/4 = 75.75. Position 75.75 lies in the block 72–92 which corresponds to age 17. Therefore Q3 = 17 years.
- IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 17 − 14 = 3 years.

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) Range = 1.2 cm. Interquartile range = 0.4 cm.
- (b) Range = 5 years. Interquartile range = 3 years.",2552,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- Type of diagram: a table of data (list of masses for two teams).
- Extracted data:
  - Team A masses (kg): 48, 53, 65, 69, 70
  - Team B masses (kg): 45, 47, 68, 70, 75
- No other labels or points in the diagram.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- (a) Calculate mean, range, variance and standard deviation for the masses of the players in both teams.
- (b) Decide whether the range is an appropriate measure of dispersion for these data and justify.
- (c) Determine which team has greater dispersion from the mean.

Note: I will treat each team as a complete group (population) and use the population formulas for variance and standard deviation (variance = average squared deviation = sum of squared deviations divided by n). If a sample-based answer (divide by n − 1) is required, I will note those values at the end.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Mean: x̄ = (sum of values)/n.
- Range: max − min.
- Population variance: σ^2 = (1/n) Σ(xi − x̄)^2.
- Population standard deviation: σ = sqrt(σ^2).
- n = 5 for each team.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.

Team A:
- Values: 48, 53, 65, 69, 70
- Sum = 48 + 53 + 65 + 69 + 70 = 305
- Mean: x̄_A = 305 / 5 = 61.0 kg
- Range: max − min = 70 − 48 = 22 kg
- Deviations from mean and squared deviations:
  - 48 − 61 = −13 → (−13)^2 = 169
  - 53 − 61 = −8  → 64
  - 65 − 61 = 4   → 16
  - 69 − 61 = 8   → 64
  - 70 − 61 = 9   → 81
- Sum of squared deviations = 169 + 64 + 16 + 64 + 81 = 394
- Population variance: σ_A^2 = 394 / 5 = 78.8 (kg^2)
- Population standard deviation: σ_A = sqrt(78.8) ≈ 8.876... ≈ 8.88 kg

Team B:
- Values: 45, 47, 68, 70, 75
- Sum = 45 + 47 + 68 + 70 + 75 = 305
- Mean: x̄_B = 305 / 5 = 61.0 kg (same mean as Team A)
- Range: max − min = 75 − 45 = 30 kg
- Deviations and squared deviations:
  - 45 − 61 = −16 → 256
  - 47 − 61 = −14 → 196
  - 68 − 61 = 7   → 49
  - 70 − 61 = 9   → 81
  - 75 − 61 = 14  → 196
- Sum of squared deviations = 256 + 196 + 49 + 81 + 196 = 778
- Population variance: σ_B^2 = 778 / 5 = 155.6 (kg^2)
- Population standard deviation: σ_B = sqrt(155.6) ≈ 12.478... ≈ 12.48 kg

(If sample variance/SD were required instead, divide sums by n−1 = 4:
- Team A sample variance = 394/4 = 98.5 → sample SD ≈ 9.93 kg.
- Team B sample variance = 778/4 = 194.5 → sample SD ≈ 13.95 kg.)

Step 5: Final Answer.
(a) Using population formulas (n = 5):
- Team A: mean = 61.0 kg; range = 22 kg; variance = 78.8 kg^2; standard deviation ≈ 8.88 kg.
- Team B: mean = 61.0 kg; range = 30 kg; variance = 155.6 kg^2; standard deviation ≈ 12.48 kg.

(b) Is range appropriate as a measure of dispersion?
- The range is simple but not generally an appropriate sole measure of dispersion because it depends only on the two extreme values and is sensitive to outliers. It does give a quick sense of spread (here it matches the conclusion from variance/SD that Team B is more spread out), but a more robust and informative measure is the variance or standard deviation which uses all data points.

(c) Which team has greater dispersion from the mean?
- Team B has the greater dispersion (larger variance and larger standard deviation).",2653,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Box K contains 4 letter cards: S, E, R, I.
  - Box L contains 3 number cards: 4, 5, 6.
  - One card is chosen at random from each box; all 4×3 = 12 paired outcomes are equally likely.
  - Labeled points (outcomes) are ordered pairs (letter from K, number from L).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Calculate the probability that the draw yields a letter ""S"" from box K OR a multiple of 3 from box L.
- Note: Among {4,5,6} the only multiple of 3 is 6. The event is the union: (K = S) ∪ (L = 6).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Sample space S = {(K,L) : K ∈ {S,E,R,I}, L ∈ {4,5,6}} with |S| = 12.
- Event A = {(K = S) or (L = 6)}.
- Use either direct listing or inclusion–exclusion:
  - P(K = S) = 1/4
  - P(L = 6) = 1/3
  - P(K = S and L = 6) = 1/12

- Spinner: 6 equal sectors, 2 red sectors and 4 yellow sectors. Thus P(red) = 2/6 = 1/3, P(yellow) = 4/6 = 2/3.
- Table of vouchers:
  - Box A (chosen if spinner lands red): RM50 vouchers = 20, RM10 vouchers = 5. Total in A = 20 + 5 = 25.
  - Box B (chosen if spinner lands yellow): RM50 vouchers = 10, RM10 vouchers = 20. Total in B = 10 + 20 = 30.
- Labeled rule: red → choose from box A; yellow → choose from box B.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: For an estimated 450 eligible customers, calculate how many RM10 vouchers the shop needs to prepare (i.e., expected number of RM10 vouchers that will be given out).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Probability a customer gets RM10 = P(red)·P(RM10 | A) + P(yellow)·P(RM10 | B).
- Where P(RM10 | A) = 5/25 and P(RM10 | B) = 20/30.
- Number of RM10 vouchers needed ≈ 450 × P(a customer gets RM10).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. P(red) = 2/6 = 1/3.
2. P(yellow) = 4/6 = 2/3.
3. P(RM10 | A) = 5/25 = 1/5.
4. P(RM10 | B) = 20/30 = 2/3.
5. P(RM10 overall) = (1/3)*(1/5) + (2/3)*(2/3)

- Totals:
  - Total badminton clubs = 14 + 11 + 3 + 5 = 33
  - Total bodybuilding clubs = 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- A badminton club and a bodybuilding club are chosen at random (one from all badminton clubs, one from all bodybuilding clubs). We must compute:
  (a) Probability both selected clubs are from Kedah (i.e., badminton from Kedah AND bodybuilding from Kedah).
  (b) Probability that the badminton club is from the Federal Territories and the bodybuilding club is from Negeri Sembilan (the phrase ""respectively"" matches the order: badminton → Federal Territories, bodybuilding → Negeri Sembilan).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Total number of equally likely pairs = (total badminton clubs) × (total bodybuilding clubs) = 33 × 12 = 396.
- (a) Favorable pairs = (badminton in Kedah) × (bodybuilding in Kedah) = 14 × 6.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a)
- Favorable = 14 × 6 = 84.
- Probability = 84 / 396.
- Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 12: 84/396 = 7/33.
- Decimal approximation: 7/33 ≈ 0.2121 (≈ 21.21%).

- Type of diagram: Table of Monthly Expenses (a personal finance table).
- Key figures extracted from the diagram and problem text:
  - Monthly net salary = RM 3,800
  - Monthly commission (part-time) = RM 450
  - Rental income from second house = RM 600
  - Monthly expenses (from table):

    - Eat at a luxury restaurant: RM 400
    - Insurance expenses: RM 350
  - Fixed monthly savings: 10% of his salary (10% of RM 3,800)

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Part (a): Create a monthly personal financial plan for Encik Nabil (show income, expenses, savings, totals, and net balance).
- Part (b): Comment on whether there will be a surplus or deficit under this plan and give relevant observations/recommendations.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Total monthly income = salary + commission + rental
- Monthly savings = 10% × salary
- Total monthly expenses = sum of expense items from table
- Total monthly outflow = total monthly expenses + monthly savings
- Net monthly balance (surplus/deficit) = total monthly income − total monthly outflow

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Total monthly income:
   - Salary = RM 3,800
   - Commission = RM 450
   - Rental = RM 600
   Total income = 3,800 + 450 + 600 = RM 4,850

2) Monthly savings (10% of salary):
   - 0.10 × 3,800 = RM 380

3) Sum the monthly expenses:
   - Housing loan (1) = 800
   - Housing loan (2) = 500
   - Food = 900
   - Utility = 150
   - Toll & petrol = 200
   - Internet = 100
   - Eat at a luxury restaurant = 400
   - Insurance = 350
   Total expenses = 800 + 500 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
                  = RM 3,400

4) Total monthly outflow:
   - Outflow = expenses + savings = 3,400 + 380 = RM 3,780

5) Net monthly balance (surplus or deficit):
   - Net = income − outflow = 4,850 − 3,780 = RM 1,070
   - This is a surplus of RM 1,070 per month.

6) Useful percentage breakdowns (for context):
   - Expenses as % of total income = 3,400 / 4,850 ≈ 70.10%
   - Savings as % of total income = 380 / 4,850 ≈ 7.84%
   - Surplus as % of total income = 1,070 / 4,850 ≈ 22.06%
   - Housing loans combined = 1,300 / 4,850 ≈ 26.80% of total income

(b) Comments on surplus/deficit and recommendations
- Encik Nabil will experience a monthly surplus of RM 1,070 under this plan (no deficit).
- This surplus is a healthy buffer (≈22% of total income) and can be used to:
  - Build an emergency fund (recommended 3–6 months of living expenses),
  - Make extra principal payments on housing loans to reduce interest and loan term,
  - Increase investments or retirement contributions,
  - Increase fixed savings above 10% if he wishes to reach financial goals sooner.
- Observations about current spending:
  - Housing loans and food are large portions of his budget (combined housing 26.8%, food 18.6%).
  - The discretionary expense ""eat at a luxury restaurant"" (RM 400) is a noticeable chunk (≈8.3%); reducing this could accelerate savings or debt repayment.
- Recommendation: Keep the RM 380 automatic savings, allocate part of the RM 1,070 surplus each month to (a) an emergency fund until 3–6 months of necessary expenses are covered, (b) extra loan repayment or low-risk investments, and (c) discretionary spending/long-term goals.

    - Savings = 100
    - Insurance = 200
  - Total expenses = 5 750
  - Mrs Thong’s income balance (leftover) = 250
Notes: The table lists “Savings = 100” as part of monthly expenses; the “income balance = 250” is the remaining unallocated money each month (6 000 − 5 750 = 250).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- (a) Decide whether Mrs Thong spends her money wisely (i.e., evaluate her budgeting and savings behaviour).
- (b) Determine whether, with her current spending behaviour, she can buy a property worth RM500 000 within 6 years.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Monthly designated savings (from the table) = 100 RM.
- Monthly unallocated balance = 250 RM.
- Possible monthly saved amount scenarios:
  1) If she only saves the designated “Savings” = 100 RM/month.
  2) If she saves the entire leftover balance as well = 250 RM/month (or 250 + 100 = 350 RM if she decides to put both savings line and income balance into a savings fund — clarify below).
- Time horizon: 6 years = 6 × 12 = 72 months.
- Required monthly saving to reach RM500 000 in 72 months = 500 000 / 72.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Compute total months: 6 years × 12 months/year = 72 months.
2) Scenario A — saving only the designated “Savings”:
   - Monthly saving = 100 RM.
   - Total saved in 72 months = 100 × 72 = 7 200 RM.
   - Percentage of goal = (7 200 / 500 000) × 100% = 1.44%.
3) Scenario B — saving the entire income balance (250 RM) instead of or in addition:
   - If she saves the 250 RM leftover each month (ignoring the 100 labelled savings), total in 72 months = 250 × 72 = 18 000 RM.
   - Percentage of goal = (18 000 / 500 000) × 100% = 3.6%.
   - If she actually saves both the labelled 100 and the leftover 250 (i.e., saves 350 RM/month), total = 350 × 72 = 25 200 RM (5.04% of the goal).
4) Required monthly saving to reach RM500 000 in 72 months:
   - Required per month = 500 000 / 72 ≈ 6 944.44 RM per month.
5) Shortfall comparisons:
   - Compared to saving 100 RM/month: shortfall per month = 6 944.44 − 100 ≈ 6 844.44 RM.
   - Compared to saving 250 RM/month: shortfall = 6 944.44 − 250 ≈ 6 694.44 RM.
   - Compared to saving 350 RM/month: shortfall = 6 944.44 − 350 ≈ 6 594.44 RM.

Step 5: Final Answer.
(a) Does Mrs Thong spend her money wisely?
- No — her savings rate is very low. She only has RM100 explicitly allocated to savings each month (1.67% of her RM6 000 income). Financially prudent advice normally recommends saving a substantially larger proportion (commonly 10%–20% of income) and building an emergency fund equivalent to 3–6 months’ expenses. Her current leftover (RM250) is small and total monthly expenses (RM5 750) leave little buffer. Therefore her current spending behaviour is not wise if her goals include major purchases or financial security.

(b) Will she be able to buy a RM500 000 property in 6 years with her current spending behaviour?
- No. With current designated savings of RM100/month she would accumulate only RM7 200 in 6 years, which is 1.44% of RM500 000. Even if she saves the entire monthly leftover RM250, she would save RM18 000 in 6 years (only 3.6% of the target). To reach RM500 000 in 72 months she would need about RM6 944.44 per month — far more than she currently saves. Thus, under her present spending behaviour she cannot achieve that goal.

Brief practical note (if she wants next steps): To get closer to the goal she would need a dramatic increase in monthly savings (or large external funding, mortgage, or very high investment returns). Practical adjustments include cutting large expenses (e.g., rental, transport), increasing income, and redirecting the leftover and other expenses into savings/investments.",3427,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
