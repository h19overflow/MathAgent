Chapter 1_Q1.png,"No. The pizza with diameter of 30 cm is more
worth it.",,Variation,English,yes,4,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
- High-level principle: geometry of circles (area ∝ radius^2 ∝ diameter^2). To test ""price varies directly as surface area"" we check whether price is proportional to area — equivalently whether price/area (or price/diameter^2) is constant for all pizzas.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: pictorial data of three circular pizzas with diameters and prices.
- Extracted data:
  - Pizza A: diameter d1 = 15 cm, price p1 = RM 12.
  - Pizza B: diameter d2 = 23 cm, price p2 = RM 25.
  - Pizza C: diameter d3 = 30 cm, price p3 = RM 35.
- Surface area formula: A = π (d/2)^2 = (π/4) d^2. This aligns with the principle that area ∝ d^2.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal: Decide whether price p varies directly (proportionally) with surface area A. If not, determine which pizza is the best purchase (i.e., gives most area per ringgit or lowest price per unit area).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Price ∝ area would mean p = k A for some constant k, i.e. p/A constant for all pizzas.
- Since A = (π/4) d^2, checking proportionality is equivalent to checking whether p/d^2 is constant across pizzas (π/4 is common factor).
- Compute p/d^2 or p/A (or area per RM = A/p) for each pizza and compare.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Compute d^2 for each pizza:
   - d1^2 = 15^2 = 225
   - d2^2 = 23^2 = 529
   - d3^2 = 30^2 = 900

2) Compute p/d^2:
   - p1/d1^2 = 12 / 225 = 0.053333... (exact 12/225 = 4/75)
   - p2/d2^2 = 25 / 529 ≈ 0.047282
   - p3/d3^2 = 35 / 900 = 0.038888... (exact 7/180)

   These three values are not equal, so price is not proportional to d^2 (hence not proportional to area).

3) Compute exact areas (symbolically) and area per RM to identify best value:
   - A1 = π(15/2)^2 = π·56.25 = 56.25π cm^2
   - A2 = π(23/2)^2 = π·132.25 = 132.25π cm^2
   - A3 = π(30/2)^2 = π·225 = 225π cm^2

   Area per RM = A/p:
   - A1/p1 = 56.25π / 12 = (56.25/12)π = 4.6875 π ≈ 4.6875·3.14159 ≈ 14.72 cm^2 per RM
   - A2/p2 = 132.25π / 25 = (132.25/25)π = 5.29 π ≈ 16.62 cm^2 per RM
   - A3/p3 = 225π / 35 = (225/35)π = 6.428571... π ≈ 20.20 cm^2 per RM

   Alternatively, price per cm^2 = p/A:
   - p1/A1 = 12 / (56.25π) = (12/56.25)/π ≈ 0.213333/π ≈ 0.0679 RM per cm^2
   - p2/A2 = 25 / (132.25π) ≈ 0.0602 RM per cm^2
   - p3/A3 = 35 / (225π) ≈ 0.0495 RM per cm^2

Step 5: Final Answer
- Conclusion: No — the price does not vary directly as surface area (p/A is not constant).
- Best value: The 30 cm pizza is worth buying (it provides the largest area per ringgit and the lowest price per cm^2).

Final boxed result:
[ Price is not proportional to area. Best buy: 30 cm pizza (RM35). ]",2186,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
Chapter 1_Q2.png,7 cm,,Variation,English,yes,3,"Step 0 — Principle Abstraction
- High-level principle: direct variation (proportionality). The area L of a semicircle varies directly as the square of its diameter d, so L = k d^2 for some constant k.

Step 1 — Diagram Deconstruction
- Diagram type: two semicircles with given diameters and areas.
- Extracted data:
  - For the first semicircle: d = 2.8 cm, L = 3.08 cm^2.
  - For the second semicircle: d = unknown, L = 19.25 cm^2.
- These data fit the direct-variation model L = k d^2.

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
- Goal: find the value of d (the diameter in cm) when L = 19.25 cm^2, using the direct-variation relation and the given data.

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
- Model: L = k d^2.
- Use the known pair (d = 2.8, L = 3.08) to determine k:
  k = L / d^2 = 3.08 / (2.8)^2.
- Then solve for d when L = 19.25:
  d^2 = L / k = 19.25 / k, so d = sqrt(19.25 / k).

Step 4 — Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Compute k exactly:
   k = 3.08 / (2.8)^2 = 3.08 / 7.84.
   Write as fraction: 3.08 = 308/100, 7.84 = 784/100, so k = (308/100) / (784/100) = 308/784.
   Simplify 308/784 by 4: 308/4 = 77, 784/4 = 196, so k = 77/196.

2. Compute d^2 for L = 19.25:
   Note 19.25 = 77/4.
   d^2 = L / k = (77/4) / (77/196) = (77/4) * (196/77) = 196/4 = 49.

3. Take the positive square root (diameter is positive):
   d = sqrt(49) = 7 cm.

Step 5 — Final Answer
- d = 7 cm

(b) The area of the curved surface will
decrease.",,Variation,English,yes,3,"Step 0: Principle Abstraction
- High-level principle: direct variation (direct proportionality). The curved surface area A of a cone varies directly as the base radius r and the slant height s, so A is proportional to r·s.

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Diagram type: labelled cone (geometric diagram).
- Extracted features and given data:
  - A = curved surface area (cm^2).
  - r = radius of base (cm).
  - s = slant height (cm).
  - Given: A = 88 cm^2 when r = 3.5 cm and s = 8 cm.
  - Questions ask for A when r = 5 cm and s = 9.8 cm, and for the change in A if s decreases while r is fixed.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Find A for new r and s values using the direct-variation relationship.
- (b) Describe/compute how A changes when s decreases with r fixed (give formula relating change in A to change in s).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Since A varies directly as r and s, there is a constant k such that
  A = k · r · s.
- Use the given values to find k:
  88 = k · 3.5 · 8.
- Then compute A for r = 5, s = 9.8:
  A = k · 5 · 9.8.
- For change in A when r is fixed: ΔA = k · r · Δs (so A changes proportionally to s).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Find k:
   88 = k · 3.5 · 8
   3.5 · 8 = 28
   k = 88 / 28 = 22 / 7.

   So A = (22/7) · r · s.

2) Compute A for r = 5, s = 9.8:
   A = (22/7) · 5 · 9.8.
   Note 9.8 = 98/10 = 49/5, so
   5 · 9.8 = 5 · (49/5) = 49.
   Hence A = (22/7) · 49 = 22 · 7 = 154 cm^2.

3) Change in A when s changes and r fixed:
   With A = (22/7) r s, for fixed r,
   ΔA = (22/7) · r · Δs.
   Thus:
   - If s decreases by an amount Δs (negative), A decreases by (22/7)·r·|Δs|.
   - Percentage change in A equals percentage change in s (since A ∝ s for fixed r).

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) A = 154 cm^2.
- (b) With radius fixed, the change in area is ΔA = (22/7)·r·Δs. In particular, if s decreases, A decreases by (22/7)·r times the decrease in s (percentage change in A equals percentage change in s).

FINAL ANSWERS:
(a) 154 cm^2
(b) ΔA = (22/7)·r·Δs (so A decreases proportionally to the decrease in s for fixed r).",2198,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

The high-level principle is a system of linear equations (two linear equations in two unknowns). Solving will use linear algebra / matrix methods (invertible 2x2 matrix or Cramer's rule).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
Type of mathematical diagram: tabular data leading to a linear system.
Extracted key features from the table:
- Let x = number of glasses of Drink P.
- Let y = number of glasses of Drink Q.
- Protein per glass: P gives 6 g, Q gives 4 g.
- Calories per glass: P gives 95 kcal, Q gives 110 kcal.
Diet requirements:
- Total protein required = 16 g.
- Total calories required = 300 kcal.
These quantities align with the system of two linear equations in x and y.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
(a) Form two linear equations from the above information.
(b) Calculate the numbers of glasses x and y using the matrix method (solve the 2x2 linear system).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
From protein: 6x + 4y = 16.
From calories: 95x + 110y = 300.
Matrix form: A [x y]^T = b, where
A = [[6, 4],
     [95, 110]],
[x y]^T = column vector of unknowns,
b = [16, 300]^T.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation (matrix method)
Compute determinant of A:
det(A) = 6*110 - 95*4 = 660 - 380 = 280.

Since det(A) ≠ 0, A is invertible. Inverse of a 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] is (1/det)[[d,-b],[-c,a]].
So A^{-1} = (1/280) * [[110, -4], [-95, 6]].

Multiply A^{-1} by b to get [x y]^T:
x = (1/280) * (110*16 + (-4)*300)
  = (1/280) * (1760 - 1200)
  = (1/280) * 560
  = 560/280
  = 2.

y = (1/280) * ((-95)*16 + 6*300)
  = (1/280) * (-1520 + 1800)
  = (1/280) * 280
  = 280/280
  = 1.

(Check by substitution:
Protein: 6(2) + 4(1) = 12 + 4 = 16 ✓
Calories: 95(2) + 110(1) = 190 + 110 = 300 ✓)

- Goal: Calculate the road tax for (a) the motorcycle with 220 cc and (b) the private car with 1 860 cc, using the provided rate table. Link to principle: apply the appropriate piecewise formula (base rate ± progressive addition) for each vehicle's engine capacity interval.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Motorcycle (cc = 220): falls in 201–250 cc bracket → Tax_motorcycle = Base_Rate_201_250 = RM 50.00.
- Car (cc = 1860): falls in 1 801–2 000 cc bracket → Tax_car = Base_Rate_1801_2000 + (ProgressiveRate) × (cc − 1800)
  - Base_Rate_1801_2000 = RM 280.00
  - ProgressiveRate = RM 0.50 per cc
  - Excess cc = 1860 − 1800 = 60 cc

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

  - Tax_motorcycle = RM 50.00 (no progressive addition).
- Car:
  - Determine bracket: 1860 ∈ [1801,2000].
  - Excess = 1860 − 1800 = 60 cc.
  - Progressive addition = 60 × RM 0.50 = RM 30.00.
  - Tax_car = RM 280.00 + RM 30.00 = RM 310.00.

- High-level principle: personal income tax computation for resident individuals using progressive tax rates (application of tax reliefs to obtain chargeable income, then apply the statutory tax-rate schedule).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction (extract data from the problem)
- Annual salary of Encik Suhaimi: RM85,700 (wife has no income).
- Available reliefs and amounts claimed (limits applied where relevant):
  - Individual relief: RM9,000
  - Life insurance and EPF (claimed RM7,760, but limited to RM7,000) → deduction used = RM7,000
  - Lifestyle (claimed RM2,000, limit RM2,500) → deduction used = RM2,000
  - Spouse relief (wife has no income): RM4,000
  - Medical treatment expenses for parents (claimed RM1,500, limit RM5,000) → deduction used = RM1,500
- These items align with the principle: subtract allowable reliefs from total income to get chargeable income, then apply tax rates.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Calculate the total income tax payable for Encik Suhaimi and his wife using joint assessment. Since the wife has no income, the combined (joint) chargeable income equals Suhaimi’s chargeable income after reliefs. Then compute tax using the progressive tax schedule.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Total allowable reliefs = sum of allowed deductions:
  individual + life/EPF (limited) + lifestyle (limited) + spouse + parents medical (limited).
- Chargeable income = Gross income − Total allowable reliefs.
- Compute tax by applying the progressive tax rates to portions of the chargeable income within each slab.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Sum allowable reliefs:
   - Individual = 9,000
   - Life insurance & EPF (limited) = 7,000
   - Lifestyle = 2,000
   - Spouse = 4,000
   - Medical for parents = 1,500
   Total reliefs = 9,000 + 7,000 + 2,000 + 4,000 + 1,500 = RM23,500

2) Chargeable income:
   Gross income 85,700 − Total reliefs 23,500 = RM62,200

3) Apply progressive tax rates (use the standard resident individual brackets):
   - 0 – 5,000: 0% → tax = 0
   - 5,001 – 20,000: 15,000 at 1% → tax = 15,000 × 1% = RM150.00
   - 20,001 – 35,000: 15,000 at 3% → tax = 15,000 × 3% = RM450.00
   - 35,001 – 50,000: 15,000 at 8% → tax = 15,000 × 8% = RM1,200.00
   - 50,001 – 62,200: 12,200 at 14% → tax = 12,200 × 14% = RM1,708.00

   Total tax = 0 + 150 + 450 + 1,200 + 1,708 = RM3,508.00

The high-level principle is geometry of similar figures and area scaling under enlargement: if a 2D figure is enlarged by a linear scale factor k, lengths multiply by k and areas multiply by k^2. For concentric circles, the annulus area equals π(R^2 − r^2), and if R = k·r then annulus area = π r^2 (k^2 − 1).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
Type of diagram: two concentric circles (an annulus) with common centre O.
Extracted data:
- Small circle radius r = 3 cm.
- Coloured region is the annulus between the large and small circle with area = 47.25π cm^2.
- Let large radius be R and linear scale factor k so that R = k·r.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
Goal: calculate the scale factor k of the enlargement (the factor by which radii are multiplied).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Using R = k·r and annulus area = π(R^2 − r^2) = π r^2 (k^2 − 1).
Plug known r = 3 cm and annulus area 47.25π:
π · 3^2 · (k^2 − 1) = 47.25π.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Cancel π from both sides:
9 (k^2 − 1) = 47.25

2) Divide both sides by 9:
k^2 − 1 = 47.25 / 9 = 5.25

3) Solve for k^2:
k^2 = 5.25 + 1 = 6.25

4) Take positive square root (scale factor is positive):
k = sqrt(6.25) = 2.5

Step 1 — Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Pinhole camera (similar triangles).
- Given/extracted features:
  - Scale factor m = −1/80.
  - Distance from pinhole to image plane (image distance) di = 15 cm (label shown on top of the box).
  - The object (tree) is on the other side of the pinhole at distance do (unknown).
- These features match the similar-triangles relation m = −di/do.

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
- Required: The horizontal distance, in cm, between the tree (object) and its image. In the pinhole setup the image lies on the opposite side of the pinhole, so the horizontal separation = do + di.

- This is a problem in plane geometry: properties of a trapezium (trapezoid). We will use formulas for perimeter (sum of side lengths) and area of a trapezium: Area = (1/2)·(sum of parallel sides)·height. Congruent sections means the trapezium is partitioned into three identical smaller trapezia, so dimensions of the whole follow from the labelled small top segment.

Step 1 — Diagram deconstruction
- Type of diagram: trapezium (one pair of parallel sides horizontal).
- Given/observed features:
  - Height (left vertical side) = 200 m.
  - Bottom base (longer parallel side) = 320 m.
  - The top edge is partitioned into three equal top segments; one such top segment is labelled 80 m. Hence top segment per section = 80 m.
  - Because there are three congruent sections, the whole top base = 3 × 80 m = 240 m.
  - The right (slanted) side connects top-right at x = 240 to bottom-right at x = 320, so its horizontal run = 320 − 240 = 80 m and its vertical drop = 200 m.

All extracted elements are consistent with trapezoid geometry and the congruent partitioning.

Step 2 — Question interpretation
- (a) Find the perimeter of the trapezium (in metres).
- (b) Find the area, in m^2, of each congruent section (i.e. area of one of the three identical smaller trapezia).
These link directly to the trapezium formulas using the lengths identified in Step 1.

Step 3 — Mathematical formulation
- Let top base = a = 240 m, bottom base = b = 320 m, height = h = 200 m.
- Left side length = h = 200 m (vertical).
- Right side length = sqrt((horizontal difference)^2 + (vertical difference)^2) = sqrt((320−240)^2 + 200^2).
- Perimeter P = a + b + left side + right side.
- Total area A_total = 1/2 · (a + b) · h.
- Area of each section A_section = A_total / 3 (since three congruent sections).

Step 4 — Step-by-step calculation
1) Right side length:
   horizontal difference = 320 − 240 = 80 m,
   vertical difference = 200 m,
   right side = sqrt(80^2 + 200^2) = sqrt(6400 + 40000) = sqrt(46400).
   Factor: 46400 = 100·464 = 100·(16·29) = 1600·29, so
   right side = 40·sqrt(29) m.

2) Perimeter:
   P = top + bottom + left + right
     = 240 + 320 + 200 + 40·sqrt(29)
     = 760 + 40·sqrt(29) m.
   Numeric approximation: sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3851648, so
   40·sqrt(29) ≈ 215.4066,
   P ≈ 760 + 215.4066 = 975.4066 ≈ 975.41 m.

3) Total area:
   A_total = 1/2 · (240 + 320) · 200
           = 1/2 · 560 · 200
           = 280 · 200
           = 56,000 m^2.

4) Area of each congruent section:
   A_section = A_total / 3 = 56,000 / 3 m^2 = 18,666 2/3 m^2 ≈ 18,666.67 m^2.
   (Check via small trapezoid formula: top_small = 80, bottom_small = 320/3,
    A_small = 1/2·(80 + 320/3)·200 = 100·(80 + 106 2/3) = 100·186 2/3 = 18,666 2/3.)

Step 5 — Final answer
- Perimeter P = 760 + 40·sqrt(29) m ≈ 975.41 m.

Extracted features:
- Length of the plank (hypotenuse) = 8 m.
- Horizontal distance from the wall to the foot of the plank (adjacent side) = 6 m.

- Total observations: each ogive reaches about 20 at the top, so N = 20 throws for each person.
- Key feature for part (a): we must read each curve’s cumulative frequency at distance x = 15.45 m (the vertical line midway between 14.45 and 16.45).

  (a) Cumulative frequencies at 15.45 (approximate read from the graph)
  - Rozaidy: F_R(15.45) ≈ 9 (≈ 9 of 20 throws are ≤ 15.45)

Step 5 — Final Answer
- (a) The distribution is not symmetrical. It is negatively skewed (skewed to the left): frequencies increase to a peak around 7.0–8.0 mmol/L and there is a longer tail toward the lower glucose values (smaller bins on the left have nonzero counts), so the left tail is longer than the right tail.
- (b) For the whole distribution (grouped data):
  - Mean ≈ 6.80 mmol/L
  - Standard deviation ≈ 1.39 mmol/L
- (c) For readings between 6.0 and 8.9 mmol/L (approximation using the relevant classes):
  - Standard deviation ≈ 0.75 mmol/L, which is smaller than the overall SD from (b) (≈1.39).
  - Justification: restricting to 6.0–8.9 mmol/L removes the lower extreme values and concentrates the data around about 7.5 mmol/L, so the spread (SD) is lower.

- This is a grouped-data summary problem. The relevant high-level principles are calculation of the mean and standard deviation for grouped data using class midpoints and frequencies. Formulas used:

- Type of diagram: frequency table for grouped data.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Required: calculate the mean and standard deviation of the blood-pressure data before and after the medicine. Then decide whether the medicine is effective in lowering blood pressure of the group (justify).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- For each group (before and after) compute:
  - Σ f·m and Σ f·m^2
  - mean = (Σ f·m)/N

  - variance_after = 4500 / 25 = 180
- sd_after = sqrt(180) ≈ 13.42 mmHg

(If one preferred sample standard deviations, divide the numerators by N−1 = 24 instead; that yields slightly larger sds: ≈15.54 before and ≈13.72 after.)

- Mean (before) = 151.6 mmHg
- Standard deviation (before) ≈ 15.23 mmHg
- Mean (after) = 142.0 mmHg
- Standard deviation (after) ≈ 13.42 mmHg

Interpretation / Justification:
- The average systolic blood pressure decreased from 151.6 mmHg to 142.0 mmHg after the medicine — a reduction of 9.6 mmHg. The spread (standard deviation) also decreased slightly. Therefore, based on these summary statistics, the medicine appears to be effective in lowering the blood pressure of this group on average.",3479,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

The high-level principle is modelling the shape of the main cable of a suspension bridge by a parabola (a quadratic function). For a symmetric span with a lowest point at midspan, the cable can be written as y = ax^2 + c where x is horizontal distance from midspan and y is the height above the deck.

Step 1 — Diagram Deconstruction
From the diagram and text:
- Total horizontal span between the two towers = 600 m, so half-span = 300 m.
- The shortest vertical distance from the main cable to the deck (at midspan) = 5 m. So the vertex (minimum) height above the deck is 5 m at x = 0.
- The cable attaches at the tops of the towers, which are 35 m above the deck. Thus at x = ±300 m the cable height above the deck is 35 m.
These features align with the quadratic (parabolic) model from Step 0: symmetric parabola with vertex at x = 0, y = 5, and passing through (±300, 35).

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
(a) Find the quadratic function y(x) that represents the main cable (height above the deck) across the span.
(b) If suspender cables are spaced 20 m apart along the deck, determine how many suspender cables are required across the whole span (“on both sides of the bridge”).

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
(a) Use a symmetric quadratic with vertex at x = 0: y = a x^2 + 5. Use the known point (300, 35) to solve for a:
35 = a(300)^2 + 5.

(b) The deck length over which suspenders are placed is 600 m. If suspenders are placed every 20 m along that length, the number of suspender positions equals (span / spacing) + 1 (including both endpoints), i.e., 600/20 + 1. Also note how these distribute relative to the midspan if needed.

Step 4 — Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) Solve for a:
35 = a(300)^2 + 5
35 − 5 = a·90,000
30 = 90,000 a
a = 30 / 90,000 = 1 / 3,000.

So the parabola (height above deck) is
y(x) = (1/3000) x^2 + 5, for −300 ≤ x ≤ 300.

(b) Number of suspender positions with 20 m spacing over 600 m:
Number = 600 / 20 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31.

Interpretation of placement:
- Positions along x: −300, −280, −260, …, 0, 20, 40, …, 300 (step 20 m) — total 31 positions.
- From center to a tower (inclusive) there are (300/20) + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 positions; excluding the central hanger, each half has 15 additional hangers. So you can say 16 hangers on each half counting the center twice, or simply 31 hangers total across the full span.

Step 5 — Final Answer
(a) Function of the main cable (height above deck, x in metres from midspan):
y(x) = (1/3000) x^2 + 5.

(b) Number of suspender cables required across the 600 m span with 20 m spacing:
31 suspenders in total.
(Equivalently: 16 positions from center to each tower inclusive; excluding the single central suspender, there are 15 additional suspenders on each side, giving 15 + 15 + 1 = 31.)",3637,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- High-level principle: models of temporal change / curve fitting. The three candidate model-types are: linear model (constant rate), quadratic model (polynomial of degree 2 with one turning point), and exponential model (rapid initial change then approaching a horizontal asymptote).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Given data points from the table:
  - (t, T): (0 s, 200 °C), (40 s, 140 °C), (80 s, 100 °C), (120 s, 75 °C).
- Visual features of the three plotted curves A, B, C:
  - Curve C (blue): straight line decreasing roughly at a constant slope, crosses below 0 °C somewhere near t ≈ 200 s.
  - Curve B (pink/red): decreasing curve that flattens out and approaches a positive horizontal asymptote (levels off above 0 °C).
  - Curve A (purple): decreases initially but has a clear minimum and then increases (a turning point and upward growth for larger t).
- These graphical characteristics align with: linear → straight line (C); exponential → rapid decay then asymptote (B); quadratic → single turning point (A).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Part (a): Identify which of A, B, C correspond to: linear model, quadratic model, exponential model.
- Part (b): Decide which model among A, B, C best describes the temperature for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s, and explain why the other models do not fit well.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Linear model: T(t) = m t + T0. Use two points to find slope m and predict behavior at larger t.
- Quadratic model: T(t) = a t^2 + b t + c. Use three points to determine a, b, c and see predicted behavior at t = 250 s.
- Exponential model (physically plausible cooling): T(t) = T_env + (T0 − T_env) e^{-k t}, where T_env is ambient temperature and k>0. Behavior: decays and approaches T_env from above.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Identify linear model (C) and compute its slope and extrapolation:
   - Use points (0,200) and (120,75):
     slope m = (75 − 200)/(120 − 0) = −125/120 = −1.0416667 °C/s.
   - Linear model: T_lin(t) = 200 − 1.0416667 t.
   - Extrapolate to t = 250 s: T_lin(250) = 200 − 1.0416667×250 = 200 − 260.41667 = −60.41667 °C.
   - Conclusion: linear model would predict temperatures well below 0 °C by t = 250 s, which is physically unlikely for a cooling sample in a room.

2) Fit a quadratic through three data points and examine behavior:
   - Let T_q(t) = a t^2 + b t + c. From (0,200) ⇒ c = 200.
   - Use (80,100): 6400 a + 80 b + 200 = 100 ⇒ 6400 a + 80 b = −100.  (Eq.1)
   - Use (120,75): 14400 a + 120 b + 200 = 75 ⇒ 14400 a + 120 b = −125.  (Eq.2)
   - Solve Eq.1 & Eq.2:
     Multiply Eq.1 by 1.5: 9600 a + 120 b = −150.
     Subtract from Eq.2: (14400 − 9600) a = −125 − (−150) ⇒ 4800 a = 25 ⇒ a = 25/4800 = 1/192 ≈ 0.00520833.
     Then 6400 a + 80 b = −100 ⇒ 6400*(1/192) + 80 b = −100 ⇒ 33.333333 + 80 b = −100 ⇒ 80 b = −133.333333 ⇒ b = −133.333333/80 = −5/3 ≈ −1.6666667.
   - Quadratic model: T_q(t) = (1/192) t^2 − (5/3) t + 200.
   - Evaluate at t = 250 s:
     (1/192)·250^2 = (1/192)·62500 = 62500/192 = 325.520833...
     −(5/3)·250 = −416.666667
     T_q(250) = 325.520833 − 416.666667 + 200 = 108.854166 ≈ 108.85 °C.
   - Conclusion: the quadratic fitted to early data predicts the temperature will rise again to ≈ 109 °C by 250 s, which is unrealistic for passive cooling (no added heat).

3) Character of the exponential model (B):
   - Form: T_exp(t) = T_env + (200 − T_env) e^{-k t}. Qualitatively: rapid drop initially, then approach T_env as t increases (levels off above 0 °C).
   - No need to fully solve for T_env and k to recognize behavior: exponential model is the only one that naturally approaches a positive asymptote (room temperature), remaining above that asymptote for all t and never going negative or rising back up.
   - As a plausibility check, if one assumes a plausible room temperature T_env ≈ 25 °C, then:
     Using T(0) = 200 ⇒ amplitude = 175. Using T(120) = 75 gives 75 ≈ 25 + 175 e^{-120 k} ⇒ e^{-120 k} ≈ 50/175 = 2/7 ⇒ k ≈ −(1/120) ln(2/7) ≈ 0.01041 s^(-1).
     Then T_exp(250) ≈ 25 + 175 e^{-0.01041·250} ≈ 25 + 175 e^{-2.603} ≈ 25 + 175·0.074 ≈ 25 + 12.95 ≈ 37.95 °C.
     This demonstrates exponential gives a plausible physically realistic prediction (levels off near ambient, stays positive and does not rise).

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) Identification:
  - A is the quadratic model (has a minimum then increases).
  - B is the exponential model (decays and levels off to a positive asymptote).
  - C is the linear model (straight line with constant negative slope).
- (b) Best model for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s:
  - The exponential model B best describes the temperature over 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s.
  - Reason: physical cooling tends to approach ambient temperature and the exponential curve decays rapidly at first then levels off to a positive asymptote (room temperature). The linear model C extrapolates to negative temperatures (e.g., ≈ −60.4 °C at t = 250 s), which is unrealistic. The quadratic model A, when fitted to the early data, predicts the temperature will increase again (≈ 108.85 °C at t = 250 s), also unrealistic for passive cooling. Therefore B (exponential) is the most physically and numerically plausible model for the given time range.",4908,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

- High-level principle: linear relationship (rate of change) between altitude and temperature. Temperature decreases at a constant rate with height, so temperature T as a function of altitude x is a linear function: T(x) = T0 + m x, where m is the constant slope (change in °C per meter).

Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Diagram type: graph / tabulated values for temperature vs altitude.
- Extracted data from the diagram/text:
  - Temperature at 0 m (sea level): 30°C.
  - Temperature at 1 000 m: 23.5°C.
  - Temperature at 2 000 m: 17°C.
  - Temperature at 3 000 m: 10.5°C.
  - Given average rate: temperature decreases 6.5°C per 1 000 m.
  - Mount Kinabalu height noted: 4095 m (useful for domain).

These features are consistent with a constant negative slope (linear decrease).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Write an equation that expresses the temperature T (in °C) as a function of altitude x (in m) for the situation shown.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Use linear model T(x) = T0 + m x.
- Known T0 = T(0) = 30°C.
- Slope m = change in temperature per meter = (−6.5°C)/(1000 m) = −6.5/1000 °C per m = −0.0065 °C/m.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Compute slope from the 0 m and 1000 m values:
   m = (T(1000) − T(0)) / (1000 − 0) = (23.5 − 30) / 1000 = −6.5 / 1000 = −0.0065.
2. Form the linear equation:
   T(x) = T(0) + m x = 30 + (−0.0065) x = 30 − 0.0065 x.
3. Quick checks:
   - T(1000) = 30 − 0.0065(1000) = 30 − 6.5 = 23.5°C (matches).
   - T(3000) = 30 − 0.0065(3000) = 30 − 19.5 = 10.5°C (matches).

Step 5: Final Answer
Final Answer: T(x) = 30 − 0.0065 x  (temperature in °C, altitude x in meters).
