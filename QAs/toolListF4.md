Excellent, thank you for providing the images. I have analyzed them and can now provide a detailed and practical list of recommended tools, modules, and workflow components tailored to the question patterns observed.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of recommendations, organized by the relevant SPM mathematics chapters.

### 1. Quadratic Functions and Equations in One Variable

**Analysis:** Questions involve forming quadratic expressions from word problems (area of land, shapes), solving for unknowns, and interpreting graphs to find key features like the axis of symmetry and maximum/minimum points (vertex).

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `QuadraticPropertiesAnalyzer`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** This is a multi-purpose solver for quadratic expressions of the form `f(x) = ax² + bx + c`. It can solve for roots, find the vertex, determine the axis of symmetry, and evaluate the function at a given `x`.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   Word problems that require forming an equation, like finding the dimensions of a piece of land (Image 24) or comparing shapes (Image 26).
    *   Graph analysis questions that ask for the axis of symmetry or the coordinates of the maximum/minimum point (Image 25).
    *   Direct requests to solve a quadratic equation `ax² + bx + c = 0`.
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (Python function signature):**
        ```python
        def analyze_quadratic(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> dict:
        ```
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "a": -1,
          "b": 6,
          "c": -5
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "roots": [1.0, 5.0],
          "vertex": { "x": 3.0, "y": 4.0 },
          "axis_of_symmetry": "x = 3.0",
          "extremum_type": "Maximum"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:**
    1.  The agent first uses an NLP component to extract the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` from the function or equation in the text (e.g., from `f(x) = -x² + 6x - 5`).
    2.  It calls the `QuadraticPropertiesAnalyzer` tool with these coefficients.
    3.  The agent receives a structured JSON object with all key properties. It can then select the specific piece of information (e.g., `"vertex"`) to answer the question accurately.

### 2. Number Bases

**Analysis:** Questions require identifying valid numbers in a given base, performing conversions between bases, and using these skills to solve word problems that involve arithmetic operations.

**Recommended Tools**

**Tool/Module #1**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `BaseValidatorAndConverter`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** Converts a number from a source base (2-10) to a target base (2-10). It should also be able to validate if a given number is valid for a specific base.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   Identifying which numbers from a list are valid in a given base (Image 27).
    *   Solving word problems that require conversion, such as calculating the perimeter given in base 4 (Image 29) or finding a daily average from a total given in base 5 (Image 28).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (Python function signature):**
        ```python
        def convert_base(number_string: str, from_base: int, to_base: int) -> str:
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "original_number": "3300",
          "original_base": 4,
          "target_base": 10,
          "result": "240"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:** For a problem like "calculate the area if the perimeter is 3300₄", the agent first calls this tool to convert 3300₄ to base 10. It then performs the main geometric calculation in base 10 and uses the tool again if the final answer needs to be in a different base.

### 3. Logical Reasoning & Mathematical Modeling

**Analysis:** Questions involve recognizing number patterns, forming a general formula (an inductive conclusion), and then using that formula to solve for a specific term.

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `SequenceAnalyzer`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** Identifies a given sequence of numbers (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 9, ...) as either an Arithmetic Progression (AP) or Geometric Progression (GP). It then returns the formula for the n-th term (Tₙ) and the common difference (`d`) or common ratio (`r`).
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   "Construct a conclusion by induction for the pattern..." (Image 3).
    *   Finding the value of a specific term in a sequence (e.g., "in the box 8").
    *   Problems involving patterns in shapes, like the semicircles (Image 2).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "sequence": [3, 5, 7, 9]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "type": "Arithmetic Progression",
          "first_term_a": 3,
          "common_difference_d": 2,
          "nth_term_formula": "2n + 1"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:**
    1.  The agent extracts the number pattern from the problem text or diagram.
    2.  It sends the sequence to the `SequenceAnalyzer`.
    3.  The tool returns the formula. The agent can then use this formula to construct the conclusion (e.g., "The number of cylinders is 2n + 1 where n is the box number") and use it to calculate the value for a specific term, like `n=8`.

### 4. Operations on Sets

**Analysis:** Questions primarily involve Venn diagrams where the number of elements in each region is given either as a number or an algebraic expression. The task is to solve for an unknown variable (`x`, `k`, `y`) using a given total or a relationship between sets.

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `VennDiagramEquationSolver`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** A symbolic tool designed to solve for unknowns in a Venn diagram. It takes the values/expressions from each region of the diagram and one or more equations based on set cardinality.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   "Calculate the value of x" when the total number of elements is given (Image 4).
    *   Solving for variables (`k`, `y`) when a relationship between sets is provided, such as `n(Q) = n(P U R)'` or `n(B') = n(B ∩ C)` (Images 5 and 6).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "regions": {
            "J_only": 7,
            "J_intersect_K_only": 2,
            "K_only": "x + 2",
            "K_intersect_L_only": 3,
            "L_only": "x + 5",
            "J_intersect_L_only": 0, // Assume 0 if not shown
            "J_intersect_K_intersect_L": 0
          },
          "equations": [
            { "expression": "J_only + J_intersect_K_only + K_only + K_intersect_L_only + L_only", "equals": 25 }
          ]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "variable": "x",
          "value": 3
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:**
    1.  An image-to-text or data extraction module identifies the expressions in each distinct region of the Venn diagram.
    2.  The agent structures this information into the JSON input format.
    3.  The `VennDiagramEquationSolver` tool constructs the algebraic equation (`7 + 2 + (x + 2) + 3 + (x + 5) = 25`) and solves for `x`.
    4.  The agent uses the result to answer the question.

---

### 5. Network in Graph Theory

**Analysis:** Questions range from identifying basic properties of a graph (vertices, edges, degrees) to solving practical pathfinding problems on weighted, directed graphs (finding the cheapest or fastest route).

**Recommended Tools**

**Tool/Module #1**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `GraphPropertiesExtractor`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** Analyzes a simple graph's structure to list its vertices (V), edges (E), and calculate the degree of each vertex and the sum of degrees.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:** Basic graph theory questions asking to determine V, n(V), E, n(E), and the sum of degrees (Image 7).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "vertices": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
          "edges": [
            {"from": "1", "to": "2", "label": "e1"},
            {"from": "1", "to": "5", "label": "e2"},
            {"from": "2", "to": "3", "label": "e3"},
            {"from": "2", "to": "4", "label": "e4"},
            {"from": "2", "to": "5", "label": "e5"},
            {"from": "3", "to": "4", "label": "e6"},
            {"from": "4", "to": "5", "label": "e7"}
          ]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "V": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
          "n(V)": 5,
          "E": ["e1", "e2", "e3", "e4", "e5", "e6", "e7"],
          "n(E)": 7,
          "sum_of_degrees": 14
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:** The agent extracts the graph structure from the diagram, calls the tool, and uses the structured output to list the required properties.

**Tool/Module #2**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `ShortestPathFinder`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** Works on directed and weighted graphs. Given a start vertex, an end vertex, and a weight to optimize for (e.g., 'cost' or 'time'), it finds the optimal path and its total weight.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:** Finding the "most economical route," "route that takes the shortest time," or "best route" from one point to another in a network (Images 8 and 9).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "graph_type": "directed",
          "edges": [
            {"from": "P", "to": "Q", "weights": {"cost": 50, "time": 1}},
            {"from": "P", "to": "R", "weights": {"cost": 130, "time": 1.5}},
            // ... all other edges
          ],
          "start_vertex": "P",
          "end_vertex": "S",
          "optimize_for": "cost" // or "time"
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "path": ["P", "Q", "S"],
          "total_weight": 165,
          "weight_type": "cost"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:** The agent parses the graph, including all weights (cost, time, distance), from the diagram. For a question like "find the most economical route," it sets `optimize_for` to `"cost"` and calls the tool. The returned path is the solution.

### 6. Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

**Analysis:** Questions require students to look at a shaded region on a Cartesian plane, bounded by one or more lines, and write down the set of linear inequalities that defines that region. Some questions add a transformation step.

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `RegionToInequalityConverter`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** Determines the inequality represented by a line and a shaded region. It takes two points to define the line and a sample point within the shaded region to determine the inequality sign (>, <, ≥, ≤). It also identifies if the line is solid or dashed.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:** "Write the linear inequalities that satisfy the shaded region..." (Images 11, 10, 12).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "line_points": [{"x": -4, "y": 0}, {"x": 0, "y": 2}],
          "test_point_in_region": {"x": -2, "y": 0},
          "line_style": "dashed" // or "solid"
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "line_equation": "y = 0.5x + 2",
          "inequality": "y < 0.5x + 2"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:**
    1.  The agent identifies the coordinates of two points on each boundary line of the shaded region.
    2.  It also picks a simple test point clearly inside the shaded region (e.g., (0,0) if applicable).
    3.  For each boundary line, it calls the `RegionToInequalityConverter` tool.
    4.  The agent then collects all the returned inequalities to provide the final answer. For questions with transformations (Image 10), the agent would first apply a transformation to the line points before calling this tool.

---

### 7. Graphs of Motion

**Analysis:** Questions focus on interpreting speed-time and distance-time graphs. Key skills are calculating the gradient for acceleration/speed and the area under the graph for distance.

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `MotionGraphCalculator`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** A tool that understands the physics of motion graphs. Given a set of points defining the graph and a time interval, it can calculate either the gradient (rate of change) or the area under the graph.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   "Calculate the rate of change of speed..." (gradient of speed-time graph) (Image 13).
    *   "Calculate the distance travelled..." (area under speed-time graph) (Image 13).
    *   "Calculate the rate of change in distance..." (gradient of distance-time graph) (Image 14).
    *   Problems requiring setting up equations where two distances (areas) are equal (Image 15).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "graph_type": "speed-time",
          "points": [{"t": 0, "v": 0}, {"t": 40, "v": 15}, {"t": 120, "v": 15}, {"t": 150, "v": 0}],
          "calculation": "area", // or "gradient"
          "interval": [40, 120]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "calculation": "area",
          "value": 1200, // (120-40) * 15
          "units": "meters"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:** The agent extracts the key coordinates from the motion graph. When asked for "distance travelled at uniform speed," it identifies the corresponding time interval `[40, 120]` and calls the tool with `calculation: "area"`. When asked for "rate of change of speed," it identifies the interval and calls the tool with `calculation: "gradient"`.

---

### 8. Measures of Dispersion for Ungrouped Data

**Analysis:** Questions provide a set of data, either as a raw list or a frequency table, and ask for various statistical measures like range, interquartile range (IQR), variance, and standard deviation.

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `UngroupedDataStatsCalculator`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** A robust calculator that takes a list of numbers or a frequency table and computes all key measures of dispersion.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:** All questions asking to calculate range, IQR, variance, and standard deviation from raw data or frequency tables (Images 16, 17, 18).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        // For a frequency table
        {
          "data_type": "frequency",
          "data": { "1": 2, "2": 5, "3": 6, "4": 9, "5": 6, "6": 2, "7": 1, "10": 1 }
        }
        // For a raw list
        // { "data_type": "raw", "data": [48, 53, 65, 69, 70] }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "count": 32,
          "mean": 3.84,
          "range": 9,
          "q1": 3,
          "median_q2": 4,
          "q3": 5,
          "interquartile_range": 2,
          "variance": 2.56,
          "standard_deviation": 1.60
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:** The agent extracts the data from the table or list in the question and formats it into the JSON input. It calls the tool once and gets all possible statistical measures. It then selects the specific values requested by the question (e.g., "variance and standard deviation") to construct the answer.

---

### 9. Probability of Combined Events

**Analysis:** Questions involve scenarios with multiple independent or dependent events (drawing cards, spinning wheels, selecting people). They require listing outcomes and calculating probabilities of combined events (using 'and' or 'or' rules).

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `SampleSpaceGenerator`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** Generates a complete list of all possible outcomes (the sample space) for a sequence of one or more probabilistic events.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   "By listing all the possible outcomes, calculate the probability..." (Image 19).
    *   Complex probability problems where understanding the sample space is key (Images 20, 21).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "events": [
            { "name": "Box_K", "outcomes": ["S", "E", "R", "I"] },
            { "name": "Box_L", "outcomes": ["4", "5", "6"] }
          ]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "sample_space_size": 12,
          "sample_space": [
            ["S", "4"], ["S", "5"], ["S", "6"],
            ["E", "4"], ["E", "5"], ["E", "6"],
            // ... and so on
          ]
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:**
    1.  The agent defines the events and their outcomes from the problem description.
    2.  It calls the `SampleSpaceGenerator` to get all possible combinations.
    3.  The agent can then filter this sample space based on the conditions in the question (e.g., "getting a letter 'S' or a multiple of 3"). For instance, it would count outcomes where `outcome[0] == 'S'` or `int(outcome[1]) % 3 == 0`.
    4.  The probability is then calculated as `(number of favorable outcomes) / (sample_space_size)`.

### 10. Financial Management

**Analysis:** Questions require creating or analyzing a personal budget. This involves summing up income and expenses and calculating the resulting surplus or deficit.

**Recommended Tool**
*   **Tool/Module Name:** `BudgetAnalyzer`
*   **Intended Function/Capabilities:** A simple but structured calculator for personal finance. It takes lists of income sources and expenses and calculates totals and the final cash flow balance.
*   **What type of question(s) it addresses:**
    *   "Create a monthly personal financial plan..." (Image 22).
    *   "Give comments on the surplus or deficit..." (Image 22).
    *   Analyzing an existing financial plan to determine its viability (Image 23).
*   **Suggested input(s) and output(s):**
    *   **Input (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "income": [
            {"source": "Salary", "amount": 3800},
            {"source": "Commission", "amount": 450},
            {"source": "Rental", "amount": 600}
          ],
          "expenses": [
            {"item": "Housing loan 1", "amount": 800},
            {"item": "Housing loan 2", "amount": 500},
            {"item": "Food", "amount": 900},
            // ... all other expenses
          ]
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "total_income": 4850,
          "total_expenses": 3400,
          "net_cash_flow": 1450,
          "status": "Surplus"
        }
        ```
*   **How it could integrate with an agent workflow:** The agent extracts all income and expense items and their values from the tables in the question. It passes this structured data to the `BudgetAnalyzer` tool. The tool returns a clean summary, which the agent can then use to formulate a textual answer, describing the financial plan and commenting on the surplus or deficit.
