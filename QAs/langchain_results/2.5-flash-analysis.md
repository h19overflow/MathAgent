1. No Answer or System Error (42 lost marks)
This was the most severe and frequent issue, accounting for over 82% of all lost marks. In 9 of the 13 failed tasks, the agent did not produce a valid answer.
Error Types: These failures were characterized by outputs such as "nan" (not a number) or system-level errors like "Solver recursion limit reached." This indicates a fundamental failure to process the prompt or generate a coherent response.
Impact: This category led to a complete loss of marks for every affected question, totaling 42 lost marks. It represents the single largest area for improvement, as no partial credit could be awarded.
2. Incorrect Answer (5 lost marks)
This category covers instances where the agent provided a complete answer, but the answer was wrong. This occurred in 2 of the 13 failed tasks.
Misinterpretation of the Question (3 lost marks): In one case, the agent correctly performed a calculation but failed to address the core constraint of the question. For example, when asked for the "safer route," it identified the "shortest route," which was explicitly incorrect according to the ground truth.
Methodological & Calculation Errors (2 lost marks): In another instance, the agent arrived at the correct qualitative conclusion but used incorrect and internally inconsistent numbers to justify it, failing to match the ground truth's required calculations.
3. Incomplete Answer (4 lost marks)
This category, affecting 2 of the 13 failed tasks, involves responses that were partially correct but failed to meet all the requirements of the prompt.
Omission of Required Components: The agent correctly solved for some parts of a question but missed others. For example, it identified most of the required linear inequalities for a shaded region but omitted one. In another case, it described the phases of motion correctly but failed to compute the final total distance and average speed as required.
