1. No Answer or System Error (34 lost marks)
The most significant issue, accounting for approximately 69% of all lost marks, was the agent's failure to produce any valid output. This occurred in 7 out of the 14 erroneous responses.
Error Types: These failures manifested as either a direct "nan" (not a number) output or a system error message, such as exceeding a recursion limit.
Impact: This category resulted in a complete loss of marks for the affected questions, totaling 34 lost marks across seven problems. This indicates a critical failure in either task processing or output generation, preventing any partial credit.
2. Incorrect or Incomplete Answers (15 lost marks)
The second category includes cases where the agent provided an answer, but it was flawed. This group accounted for the remaining 31% of lost marks and affected the other 7 erroneous responses. These errors can be further broken down:
Methodological and Factual Errors (9 lost marks): This was the most common sub-type of incorrect answer. The agent applied a flawed process or had incorrect information.
Example: In a financial calculation, the agent incorrectly calculated the final surplus by deducting savings at the wrong stage of the process.
Example: When analyzing a graph, the agent incorrectly identified the set of edges connecting the vertices, leading to wrong counts.
Incomplete Answers (3 lost marks): In two instances, the agent performed the correct calculations but failed to provide all parts of the required answer.
Example: After correctly performing all the necessary work for a multi-part physics problem, the agent omitted the final aggregated numerical answers.
Example: The agent correctly answered part (a) of a question but provided no response for part (b).
Misinterpretation of the Question (3 lost marks): In one case, the agent correctly solved a problem, but not the one that was asked.
Example: When asked to find the "safer" route, the agent identified the "shortest" route, failing to address the specific constraint in the prompt.
