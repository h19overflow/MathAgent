Overview of Performance
Out of the 22 questions detailed, the AI achieved a perfect score on 17. Mistakes were made on 5 questions, leading to a total loss of 20 marks.
The errors can be grouped into two main categories:
Misinterpretation of the Question: Errors where the AI fundamentally misunderstood the prompt, the data provided, or the scenario described.
Factual Inaccuracy or Calculation Error: Errors where the AI understood the question but failed to produce the correct answer for at least one part of it, due to incorrect calculations or flawed reasoning in the final steps.
Quantitative Analysis by Mistake Category
1. Misinterpretation of the Question
This was the most significant category, accounting for the majority of the lost marks.
Total Marks Lost: 15
Number of Instances: 3
Breakdown of Instances:
Answering a Different Question (7 marks lost):
In a question about blood-glucose histograms, the AI provided a detailed answer for a completely different problem concerning blood pressure. It failed to address any part of the actual question, resulting in a score of 0/7.
Misinterpreting the Scenario (5 marks lost):
For a question on income tax, the AI misinterpreted the assessment method by using joint assessment instead of the required separate assessment. This foundational error led to the use of incorrect tax rates and calculations, causing a loss of all 5 marks.
Misinterpreting a Diagram (3 marks lost):
In a geometry problem, the AI incorrectly interpreted a label on a diagram (treating an 80 m segment incorrectly). This initial misinterpretation caused all subsequent calculations for perimeter and area to be wrong, leading to a score of 0/3.
2. Factual Inaccuracy or Calculation Error
This category includes questions where the AI correctly addressed the prompt but failed to provide a completely correct answer.
Total Marks Lost: 5
Number of Instances: 2
Breakdown of Instances:
Partially Incorrect Answer (3 marks lost):
In a two-part question involving a quadratic model, the AI answered part (a) correctly but provided an incorrect answer for part (b). This resulted in receiving marks for the correct part but losing 3 marks for the incorrect one.
Partially Incorrect Calculation (2 marks lost):
For a statistics question requiring the calculation of two percentages, the AI correctly calculated one value (Wildan's at 45%) but failed on the other (Rozaidy's). The reasoning and conclusion in the second part of the question were correct, but the error in the initial calculation led to a loss of 2 marks.
