The problem asks us to:
1. Write a function for the area (A) of a rectangular piece of land in terms of x, given its length as (x + 20) m and width as (x + 5) m.
2. Formulate a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, given that the area of the land is 250 m².

There are no non-standard constraints.

Step 2: Solution Execution

Part (a): Write a function for the area, A m², of the land.
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
Given:
Length = (x + 20) m
Width = (x + 5) m

So, the area A can be expressed as:
A = (x + 20)(x + 5)

To expand this expression, we use the distributive property (or FOIL method):
A = x(x + 5) + 20(x + 5)
A = x² + 5x + 20x + 100
A = x² + 25x + 100

The function for the area is A(x) = x² + 25x + 100.

Part (b): If the area of the land is 250 m², write a quadratic equation in terms of x.

We are given that the area A = 250 m². We can set the area function equal to 250:
x² + 25x + 100 = 250

To get the equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, we need to move all terms to one side:
x² + 25x + 100 - 250 = 0
x² + 25x - 150 = 0

This is the quadratic equation in the required form, where a = 1, b = 25, and c = -150.

Step 3: Final Answer
The final answer is:
(a) The function for the area, A m², of the land is A(x) = x² + 25x + 100.
(b) The quadratic equation in terms of x, when the area is 250 m², is x² + 25x - 150 = 0.

The problem asks to find:
(a) The coordinates of point A.
(b) The equation of the axis of symmetry.
(c) The coordinates of point B.
(d) The coordinates of the maximum point P.

The given quadratic function is $f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5$.
The line AB is parallel to the x-axis.
Point A is on the y-axis and the line AB.
Point B is on the curve and the line AB.
Point P is the maximum point of the curve.

From the visual data, we have estimations for the coordinates of A, B, and P, which can be used for verification.

Step 2: Solution Execution

(a) Coordinates of point A:
Point A is on the y-axis, which means its x-coordinate is 0.
Point A is also on the line AB, which is parallel to the x-axis. This means that the y-coordinate of A is the same as the y-coordinate of B.
From the visual data, Point A appears to be at (0, -5). Let's assume this is correct for now and verify it with point B later.
If A is at (0, -5), then the y-coordinate of B must also be -5.

(b) Equation of the axis of symmetry:
For a quadratic function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, the axis of symmetry is given by $x = -b / (2a)$.
In this case, $a = -1$, $b = 6$, and $c = -5$.
Axis of symmetry: $x = -(6) / (2 * -1) = -6 / -2 = 3$.
The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 3$.

(c) Coordinates of point B:
Point B lies on the curve $f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 5$ and on the line AB, which is parallel to the x-axis.
Since A appears to be at (0, -5) and AB is horizontal, the y-coordinate of B is -5.
We set $f(x) = -5$ to find the x-coordinate of B:
$-x^2 + 6x - 5 = -5$
$-x^2 + 6x = 0$
$x(-x + 6) = 0$
This gives two possible x-values: $x = 0$ or $x = 6$.
$x=0$ corresponds to point A (since A is on the y-axis).
Therefore, the x-coordinate of point B is 6.
The coordinates of point B are (6, -5).

Let's verify the visual data for point B. It was estimated at (5, -5), but our calculation gives (6, -5). The calculation is more reliable.

Now we can confirm the y-coordinate of A. Since A is on the y-axis and on the line AB, and B is at (6, -5), the line AB must be y = -5. Thus, A is at (0, -5). This matches the visual estimation.

(d) Coordinates of the maximum point P:
The maximum point of a quadratic function occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the same as the axis of symmetry, which we found to be $x = 3$.
To find the y-coordinate of the maximum point, we substitute $x = 3$ into the function $f(x)$:
$f(3) = -(3)^2 + 6(3) - 5$
$f(3) = -9 + 18 - 5$
$f(3) = 9 - 5$
$f(3) = 4$.
The coordinates of the maximum point P are (3, 4).
This matches the visual estimation for point P.

Step 3: Final Answer
(a) The coordinates of point A are (0, -5).
(b) The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 3$.
(c) The coordinates of point B are (6, -5).
(d) The coordinates of the maximum point P are (3, 4).

FINAL ANSWER:
(a) The coordinates of point A are (0, -5).
(b) The equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 3$.

Chapter 1_Q3.png,20 cm,"Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to calculate the difference in perimeter between an isosceles triangle and a square. We are given information about their dimensions in terms of a variable 'y', and a relationship between their areas.

The dimensions are:
- Isosceles triangle: base = 4y cm, height = (y + 5) cm.
- Square: side length = y cm.

The constraint is that the area of the triangle is 39 cm² more than the area of the square.

Step 2: Solution Execution

First, let's find the area of the triangle and the square in terms of 'y'.

Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height
Area of triangle = (1/2) * (4y) * (y + 5)
Area of triangle = 2y * (y + 5)
Area of triangle = 2y² + 10y

Area of square = side * side
Area of square = y * y
Area of square = y²

Now, let's use the constraint that the area of the triangle is 39 cm² more than the area of the square:
Area of triangle = Area of square + 39
2y² + 10y = y² + 39

Rearrange the equation to solve for 'y':
2y² - y² + 10y - 39 = 0
y² + 10y - 39 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation for 'y' by factoring. We need two numbers that multiply to -39 and add to 10. These numbers are 13 and -3.
(y + 13)(y - 3) = 0

This gives two possible values for 'y':
y + 13 = 0  => y = -13
y - 3 = 0   => y = 3

Since 'y' represents a length, it cannot be negative. Therefore, y = 3 cm.

Now we can find the dimensions of the triangle and the square:

Isosceles triangle:
Base = 4y = 4 * 3 = 12 cm
Height = y + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 cm

To calculate the perimeter of the triangle, we need the length of the two equal sides. We can use the Pythagorean theorem. The height of an isosceles triangle bisects the base. So, we have a right-angled triangle with height = 8 cm, and half of the base = 12/2 = 6 cm.
Let 's' be the length of one of the equal sides.
s² = height² + (base/2)²
s² = 8² + 6²
s² = 64 + 36
s² = 100
s = √100
s = 10 cm

Perimeter of triangle = base + 2 * (equal side)
Perimeter of triangle = 12 + 2 * 10
Perimeter of triangle = 12 + 20
Perimeter of triangle = 32 cm

Square:
Side length = y = 3 cm

Perimeter of square = 4 * side
Perimeter of square = 4 * 3
Perimeter of square = 12 cm

Finally, calculate the difference in perimeter between both shapes:
Difference in perimeter = Perimeter of triangle - Perimeter of square
Difference in perimeter = 32 cm - 12 cm
Difference in perimeter = 20 cm

Let's verify the areas:
Area of triangle = (1/2) * 12 * 8 = 48 cm²
Area of square = 3 * 3 = 9 cm²
Area of triangle - Area of square = 48 - 9 = 39 cm². This matches the constraint.

Step 3: Final Answer
The difference in perimeter between the isosceles triangle and the square is 20 cm.

The problem asks us to calculate the average number of visitors per day in January, given the total number of visitors in base five and that the zoo is open every day in January. The answer must also be in base five.

Non-standard constraints:
- The total number of visitors is given in base five.
- The answer must be in base five.

Step 2: Solution Execution
First, we need to determine the number of days in January. January has 31 days.

Next, we need to convert the total number of visitors from base five to base ten.
20202₅ = 2 * 5⁴ + 0 * 5³ + 2 * 5² + 0 * 5¹ + 2 * 5⁰
= 2 * 625 + 0 * 125 + 2 * 25 + 0 * 5 + 2 * 1
= 1250 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 2
= 1302₁₀

Now, we calculate the average number of visitors per day in base ten.
Average = Total visitors / Number of days
Average = 1302 / 31

Let's perform the division:
1302 ÷ 31 = 42

So, the average number of visitors per day is 42 in base ten.

Finally, we need to convert the average number of visitors from base ten back to base five.
To convert 42₁₀ to base five, we find the remainders when dividing by 5:
42 ÷ 5 = 8 remainder 2
8 ÷ 5 = 1 remainder 3
1 ÷ 5 = 0 remainder 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get 132₅.

Let's verify the conversion:
132₅ = 1 * 5² + 3 * 5¹ + 2 * 5⁰
= 1 * 25 + 3 * 5 + 2 * 1
= 25 + 15 + 2
= 42₁₀

The calculation seems correct. The average number of visitors per day is 132₅.

Step 3: Final Answer
The total number of visitors in January is 20202₅. January has 31 days.
First, convert the total visitors to base 10:
20202₅ = 2 * 5⁴ + 0 * 5³ + 2 * 5² + 0 * 5¹ + 2 * 5⁰ = 2 * 625 + 0 + 2 * 25 + 0 + 2 * 1 = 1250 + 50 + 2 = 1302₁₀.
The number of days in January is 31.
Now, calculate the average number of visitors per day in base 10:
Average = 1302₁₀ / 31 = 42₁₀.
Finally, convert the average number of visitors back to base 5:
42₁₀ = 1 * 5² + 3 * 5¹ + 2 * 5⁰ = 25 + 15 + 2 = 42₁₀.
So, 42₁₀ = 132₅.

- The problem asks to calculate the area of the children's playground, which is the top-left triangular section of a rectangular playground.
- The playground is rectangular, with one side labeled ""80 m"" and the adjacent side labeled ""x m"".
- The perimeter of the playground is given as 33004 meters.
- The children's playground is the triangle formed by the top side, the left side, and the diagonal.

Step 2: Solution Execution
The problem states that the perimeter of the playground is 33004 meters. The playground is rectangular. Let the sides of the rectangle be length (l) and width (w).
From the visual data, one side is 80 m and the other is x m. So, let l = 80 m and w = x m.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w).
We are given P = 33004 m.
So, 33004 = 2(80 + x).
Divide both sides by 2:
33004 / 2 = 80 + x
16502 = 80 + x
Subtract 80 from both sides to find x:
x = 16502 - 80
x = 16422 m

The area of the children's playground is the area of the triangle formed by the top side and the left side. In a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. The top side is given as 80 m, and the left side is x m (which we found to be 16422 m).
The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = (1/2) * base * height.
In this case, the base can be considered the top side (80 m) and the height can be considered the left side (16422 m).
Area of children's playground = (1/2) * 80 m * 16422 m
Area = 40 m * 16422 m
Area = 656880 square meters.

Let's verify the constraints. The perimeter is 2 * (80 + 16422) = 2 * 16502 = 33004 m. This matches the given constraint.

Step 3: Final Answer
The area of the children's playground is calculated by first finding the unknown side 'x' using the given perimeter, and then applying the formula for the area of a triangle.

Perimeter = 33004 m
Let the sides of the rectangle be 80 m and x m.
Perimeter = 2 * (80 + x)
33004 = 2 * (80 + x)
16502 = 80 + x
x = 16502 - 80
x = 16422 m

The children's playground is a triangle with base 80 m and height x = 16422 m.
Area of children's playground = (1/2) * base * height
Area = (1/2) * 80 m * 16422 m

- Elements in J and K only: 2
- Elements in K only: $x + 2$
- Elements in K and L only: 3
- Elements in L only: $x + 5$
- Elements in J and L only: 0 (not specified, assumed to be 0)
- Elements in J, K, and L: 0 (not specified, assumed to be 0)

The problem states that $\xi = J \cup K \cup L$ and $n(\xi) = 25$. This means the sum of all elements in the distinct regions of the Venn diagram must equal 25.

So, we can write the equation:
$7 + 2 + (x + 2) + 3 + (x + 5) = 25$

Now, let's solve for $x$:
Combine the constant terms:
$7 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 19$

Combine the terms with $x$:
$x + x = 2x$

So the equation becomes:
$19 + 2x = 25$

Subtract 19 from both sides:
$2x = 25 - 19$
$2x = 6$

Divide by 2:
$x = \frac{6}{2}$
$x = 3$

Now, let's verify the solution by plugging $x=3$ back into the regions:
- J only: 7
- J and K only: 2
- K only: $3 + 2 = 5$
- K and L only: 3
- L only: $3 + 5 = 8$

Sum of all regions = $7 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 25$. This matches the given $n(\xi) = 25$.
The values for each region are non-negative, which is consistent with the number of elements.

Step 3: Final Answer
The value of $x$ is 3.

Chapter 4_Q2.png,39,"Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks to find the total number of elements in the universal set, denoted as $n(\xi)$. We are given a Venn diagram with three sets P, Q, and R, and some cardinalities of disjoint regions are provided as numbers or expressions involving $k$. A key condition is given: $n(Q) = n(P \cup R)'$. We need to use this condition to find the value of $k$ and then calculate $n(\xi)$.

Step 2: Solution Execution
First, we express $n(Q)$ and $n(P \cup R)'$ in terms of $k$ using the information from the Venn diagram.

The regions within set Q are:
- $n(P \cap Q \cap R) = 1$
- $n(P \cap Q \cap R') = 2$
- $n(P' \cap Q \cap R) = 5$
- $n(P' \cap Q \cap R') = 4k$

So, $n(Q) = 1 + 2 + 5 + 4k = 8 + 4k$.

The region $(P \cup R)'$ represents the elements that are neither in P nor in R. From the Venn diagram, these regions are:
- $n(P' \cap Q \cap R') = 4k$ (elements in Q only)
- $n(P' \cap Q' \cap R') = 2k$ (elements outside all sets)

So, $n(P \cup R)' = 4k + 2k = 6k$.

Now, we use the given condition $n(Q) = n(P \cup R)'$:
$8 + 4k = 6k$
Subtract $4k$ from both sides:
$8 = 2k$
Divide by 2:
$k = 4$

Now that we have the value of $k$, we can find the cardinality of each disjoint region within the universal set $\xi$:
- $n(P \cap Q \cap R) = 1$
- $n(P \cap Q \cap R') = 2$
- $n(P \cap Q' \cap R) = k = 4$
- $n(P' \cap Q \cap R) = 5$
- $n(P \cap Q' \cap R') = 3$
- $n(P' \cap Q \cap R') = 4k = 4 \times 4 = 16$
- $n(P' \cap Q' \cap R')$ = 2k = 2 \times 4 = 8$

The region for R only, $n(P' \cap Q' \cap R)$, is not explicitly given a value in the diagram. However, the problem asks to determine $n(\xi)$, implying a unique solution. In a standard Venn diagram representation where all regions are accounted for, if a region is not labeled, its cardinality is considered zero. Therefore, we assume $n(P' \cap Q' \cap R) = 0$.

The universal set $\xi$ is the sum of the cardinalities of all disjoint regions:
$n(\xi) = n(P \cap Q \cap R) + n(P \cap Q \cap R') + n(P \cap Q' \cap R) + n(P' \cap Q \cap R) + n(P \cap Q' \cap R') + n(P' \cap Q \cap R') + n(P' \cap Q' \cap R) + n(P' \cap Q' \cap R')$
$n(\xi) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 16 + 0 + 8$

Let's sum these values:
$n(\xi) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 5) + (3 + 16 + 0 + 8)$
$n(\xi) = 12 + 27$
$n(\xi) = 39$

To verify, let's check the condition $n(Q) = n(P \cup R)'$ with $k=4$ and $n(R \text{ only}) = 0$:
$n(Q) = 1 + 2 + 5 + 4k = 8 + 4(4) = 8 + 16 = 24$.
$n(P \cup R)' = n(P' \cap R') = n(P' \cap Q \cap R') + n(P' \cap Q' \cap R') = 4k + 2k = 6k = 6(4) = 24$.
The condition holds true.

Step 3: Final Answer
The value of $k$ is 4. The cardinalities of the disjoint regions are 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 16, 0, and 8. The total number of elements in the universal set $\xi$ is the sum of these cardinalities.

Chapter 4_Q3.png,"(a) y = 11
(b) 51","Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to find the value of 'y' and the total number of elements in the union of sets A, B, and C (n(A ∪ B ∪ C)).
The constraint given is n(B') = n(B ∩ C).
The visual data provides the number of elements in each region of the Venn diagram in terms of constants and 'y'.
The universal set is defined as ξ = A ∪ B ∪ C, which means there are no elements outside the three sets.

Step 2: Solution Execution

First, let's express the number of elements in each region and in set B and B ∩ C.
- Region A only: 2
- Region A and B only: y - 2
- Region B only: 4
- Region A and C only: 5
- Region A, B, and C: y - 1
- Region B and C only: 9
- Region C only: 12

Now, let's calculate n(B) and n(B ∩ C).
n(B) is the sum of elements in regions that are part of B:
n(B) = (Region B only) + (Region A and B only) + (Region B and C only) + (Region A, B, and C)
n(B) = 4 + (y - 2) + 9 + (y - 1)
n(B) = 4 + y - 2 + 9 + y - 1
n(B) = 2y + 10

n(B ∩ C) is the sum of elements in the intersection of B and C:
n(B ∩ C) = (Region B and C only) + (Region A, B, and C)
n(B ∩ C) = 9 + (y - 1)
n(B ∩ C) = y + 8

Now, let's consider the constraint n(B') = n(B ∩ C).
Since the universal set is ξ = A ∪ B ∪ C, the total number of elements is n(A ∪ B ∪ C).
n(B') represents the number of elements not in B.
n(B') = n(A ∪ B ∪ C) - n(B)

Let's first calculate n(A ∪ B ∪ C) by summing all the regions:
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = (Region A only) + (Region B only) + (Region C only) + (Region A and B only) + (Region A and C only) + (Region B and C only) + (Region A, B, and C)
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2 + 4 + 12 + (y - 2) + 5 + 9 + (y - 1)
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2 + 4 + 12 + y - 2 + 5 + 9 + y - 1
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 29 + 2y

Now, substitute this into the expression for n(B'):
n(B') = (29 + 2y) - (2y + 10)
n(B') = 29 + 2y - 2y - 10
n(B') = 19

Now, apply the constraint n(B') = n(B ∩ C):
19 = y + 8

Solve for y:
y = 19 - 8
y = 11

(a) The value of y is 11.

Now, let's find n(A ∪ B ∪ C) using the value of y.
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 29 + 2y
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 29 + 2(11)
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 29 + 22
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 51

(b) n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 51.

Let's verify the values of each region:
Region A only: 2
Region A and B only: y - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
Region B only: 4
Region A and C only: 5
Region A, B, and C: y - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10
Region B and C only: 9
Region C only: 12

n(B) = 4 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 32
n(B ∩ C) = 9 + 10 = 19
n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 9 + 12 = 51
n(B') = n(A ∪ B ∪ C) - n(B) = 51 - 32 = 19

The constraint n(B') = n(B ∩ C) holds true as 19 = 19.
All region values are non-negative (y-2 = 9 and y-1 = 10).

(a) The value of y is 11.

(ii) The set of edges (E) and the number of edges (n(E)).
(iii) The sum of the degrees of all vertices.

There are no non-standard constraints mentioned in the problem.

Step 2: Solution Execution

We will analyze each graph separately.

**Graph (a):**

(i) Vertices (V) and number of vertices (n(V)):
The problem statement explicitly provides:
V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
n(V) = 5

(ii) Edges (E) and number of edges (n(E)):
The problem statement explicitly provides:
E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7}
n(E) = 7

(iii) Sum of degrees:
The sum of the degrees of the vertices in any graph is equal to twice the number of edges. This is known as the Handshaking Lemma.
Sum of degrees = 2 * n(E)
Sum of degrees = 2 * 7 = 14

Let's verify by calculating degrees of each vertex:
Degree of vertex 1: connected to 2, 5 (degree = 2)
Degree of vertex 2: connected to 1, 3, 4, 5 (degree = 4)
Degree of vertex 3: connected to 2, 4 (degree = 2)
Degree of vertex 4: connected to 2, 3, 5 (degree = 3)
Degree of vertex 5: connected to 1, 2, 4 (degree = 3)
Sum of degrees = 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14. This matches the Handshaking Lemma.

**Graph (b):**

(i) Vertices (V) and number of vertices (n(V)):
The problem statement explicitly provides:
V = {P, Q, R, W, V, U, T, S} (Note: 'S' was missing in the initial list but implied by edge SP and SU)

E = {PQ, QR, RV, VW, WU, UT, SP, SU}
n(E) = 8

(iii) Sum of degrees:
Using the Handshaking Lemma:
Sum of degrees = 2 * n(E)
Sum of degrees = 2 * 8 = 16

Let's verify by calculating degrees of each vertex:
Degree of P: connected to Q, S (degree = 2)

Degree of R: connected to Q, V (degree = 2)
Degree of W: connected to V, U (degree = 2)

Degree of U: connected to W, T, S (degree = 3)
Degree of T: connected to U (degree = 1)
Degree of S: connected to P, U (degree = 2)
Sum of degrees = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16. This matches the Handshaking Lemma.

**Graph (c):**

(i) Vertices (V) and number of vertices (n(V)):
The problem statement explicitly provides:
V = {A, B, C, D, E, F}
n(V) = 6

(ii) Edges (E) and number of edges (n(E)):
The problem statement explicitly provides:
E = {AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, BE, CE}
n(E) = 8

Let's verify by calculating degrees of each vertex:
Degree of A: connected to B, F (degree = 2)
Degree of B: connected to A, C, E (degree = 3)

The problem asks us to find two routes from vertex P to vertex S in a directed weighted graph.
(a) (i) The most economical route: This means finding the path with the minimum total cost.
(a) (ii) The route that takes the shortest time: This means finding the path with the minimum total travel time.

The graph has nodes P, Q, R, and S. P is the origin, and S is the destination. Q and R are transit airports.
The weights on the edges represent (Cost, Time).
There's a fixed transit time of 45 minutes (0.75 hours) at each transit airport (Q and R).

Non-standard constraints: The transit time at Q and R is a fixed value that needs to be added to the path if these nodes are used as transit points.

Step 2: Solution Execution

First, let's list all possible routes from P to S and calculate their total cost and time, including transit times.

Possible routes:
1. P -> S
2. P -> Q -> S
3. P -> R -> S
4. P -> Q -> R -> S
5. P -> R -> Q -> S (This route is not possible because there is no direct edge from R to Q.)

Let's analyze the valid routes:

Route 1: P -> S
Cost: RM200
Time: 3 hours

Route 2: P -> Q -> S
Cost: Cost(P->Q) + Transit_Time(Q) + Cost(Q->S)
Cost: RM50 + RM0 (no cost for transit) + RM115 = RM165
Time: Time(P->Q) + Transit_Time(Q) + Time(Q->S)
Time: 1 hour + 0.75 hours + 1.4 hours = 3.15 hours

Route 3: P -> R -> S
Cost: Cost(P->R) + Transit_Time(R) + Cost(R->S)
Cost: RM130 + RM0 (no cost for transit) + RM65 = RM195
Time: Time(P->R) + Transit_Time(R) + Time(R->S)
Time: 1.5 hours + 0.75 hours + 1.1 hours = 3.35 hours

Route 4: P -> Q -> R -> S
Cost: Cost(P->Q) + Transit_Time(Q) + Cost(Q->R) + Transit_Time(R) + Cost(R->S)
Cost: RM50 + RM0 + RM45 + RM0 + RM65 = RM160
Time: Time(P->Q) + Transit_Time(Q) + Time(Q->R) + Transit_Time(R) + Time(R->S)
Time: 1 hour + 0.75 hours + 0.8 hours + 0.75 hours + 1.1 hours = 4.4 hours

Now let's summarize the costs and times for each valid route:

Route       | Total Cost | Total Time
------------|------------|-----------
P -> S      | RM200      | 3.00 hours
P -> Q -> S | RM165      | 3.15 hours
P -> R -> S | RM195      | 3.35 hours
P -> Q -> R -> S | RM160      | 4.40 hours

(a) (i) Most economical route:
Comparing the total costs: RM200, RM165, RM195, RM160.
The minimum cost is RM160, which corresponds to the route P -> Q -> R -> S.

(a) (ii) Route that takes the shortest time:
Comparing the total times: 3.00 hours, 3.15 hours, 3.35 hours, 4.40 hours.
The minimum time is 3.00 hours, which corresponds to the route P -> S.

Step 3: Final Answer
The problem asks for two things: the most economical route and the route that takes the shortest time.

For the most economical route, we compare the total costs of all possible paths, including transit times.
- P -> S: RM200
- P -> Q -> S: RM50 (P->Q) + RM115 (Q->S) = RM165 (transit time at Q is free)
- P -> R -> S: RM130 (P->R) + RM65 (R->S) = RM195 (transit time at R is free)
- P -> Q -> R -> S: RM50 (P->Q) + RM45 (Q->R) + RM65 (R->S) = RM160 (transit times at Q and R are free)

The most economical route is P -> Q -> R -> S with a total cost of RM160.

For the route that takes the shortest time, we compare the total travel times of all possible paths, including transit times.
- P -> S: 3 hours
- P -> Q -> S: 1 hour (P->Q) + 1.4 hours (Q->S) + 0.75 hours (transit at Q) = 3.15 hours
- P -> R -> S: 1.5 hours (P->R) + 1.1 hours (R->S) + 0.75 hours (transit at R) = 3.35 hours
- P -> Q -> R -> S: 1 hour (P->Q) + 0.8 hours (Q->R) + 1.1 hours (R->S) + 0.75 hours (transit at Q) + 0.75 hours (transit at R) = 4.4 hours

The route that takes the shortest time is P -> S with a total time of 3 hours.

- Restate what needs to be found: The problem asks for the shortest route from Lani's house (A) to school (E) in a directed graph.
- Identify if there are any non-standard constraints from the problem text: The only constraint is that the ""best route"" means the shortest distance.

Step 2: Solution Execution
The problem involves finding the shortest path in a directed graph with given edge weights (distances). The units of the edge weights are in meters (m) and kilometers (km). First, I need to convert all distances to a common unit, for example, meters.

Edge weights in meters:
- A to B: 400 m
- B to E: 1.1 km = 1100 m
- A to C: 350 m
- C to D: 800 m
- D to E: 650 m

Now, let's identify all possible paths from A to E and calculate their total distances:

Path 1: A -> B -> E
Distance = (A to B) + (B to E)
Distance = 400 m + 1100 m
Distance = 1500 m

Path 2: A -> C -> D -> E
Distance = (A to C) + (C to D) + (D to E)
Distance = 350 m + 800 m + 650 m
Distance = 1800 m

Comparing the distances of the two paths:
- Path 1 (A -> B -> E): 1500 m
- Path 2 (A -> C -> D -> E): 1800 m

The shortest distance is 1500 m, which corresponds to Path 1.

- Apply any qualitative constraints before finalizing: The constraint is to find the shortest distance, which has been done.
- Verify your solution makes sense in context: The calculated distances are reasonable for cycling routes within a housing estate and a municipal road. The shortest path identified is logical given the edge weights.

Step 3: Final Answer
The problem asks for the best route (shortest distance) and justification.

The possible routes from Lani's house (A) to school (E) are:
1. A -> B -> E
2. A -> C -> D -> E

Converting all distances to meters:
- A to B: 400 m
- B to E: 1.1 km = 1100 m
- A to C: 350 m
- C to D: 800 m
- D to E: 650 m

Calculating the total distance for each route:
1. Route A -> B -> E: 400 m + 1100 m = 1500 m
2. Route A -> C -> D -> E: 350 m + 800 m + 650 m = 1800 m

Comparing the two routes, the shortest distance is 1500 m.

Therefore, the best route Lani can choose is A -> B -> E.

Justification: This route is the shortest with a total distance of 1500 meters, compared to the other route (A -> C -> D -> E) which has a total distance of 1800 meters.

FINAL ANSWER: The best route Lani can choose to cycle to school is A -> B -> E. This is because it is the shortest route, with a total distance of 1500 meters (400 m from A to B + 1100 m from B to E). The alternative route A -> C -> D -> E has a total distance of 1800 meters (350 m from A to C + 800 m from C to D + 650 m from D to E).",wrong,2.1210503578186035,0,3,"The ground truth answer is Route A -> C -> D -> E (safer route despite being 300 m longer).

The problem asks us to find the linear inequalities that describe the regions shown in two separate graphs, *after* these regions have been reflected across the y-axis.

The non-standard constraint is that we need to work with the reflected image of the shaded regions, not the original ones.

Step 2: Solution Execution

Part (a): Original Shaded Region and Reflection

1.  **Analyze the original shaded region in (a):**
    *   Line 1: Vertical line segment from (5, -1) to (5, -5). This is the line $x = 5$. Since the shaded region is to the left of this line and the line is solid, the inequality is $x \le 5$.
    *   Line 2: Horizontal line segment from (0, -1) to (5, -1). This is the line $y = -1$. Since the shaded region is below this line and the line is dashed, the inequality is $y < -1$.
    *   Line 3: Line segment connecting (0, 0) and (5, -5). The slope is $(-5 - 0) / (5 - 0) = -1$. The equation of the line is $y - 0 = -1(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = -x$. Since the shaded region is above this line and the line is solid, the inequality is $y \ge -x$.

    So, the original inequalities for the shaded region in (a) are:
    $x \le 5$
    $y < -1$
    $y \ge -x$

2.  **Reflect the region across the y-axis:**
    When a point $(x, y)$ is reflected across the y-axis, its new coordinates are $(-x, y)$. We need to transform the inequalities accordingly.
    *   For $x \le 5$: The new x-coordinate is $-x$. So, $-x \le 5$, which means $x \ge -5$.
    *   For $y < -1$: The y-coordinate remains unchanged. So, $y < -1$.
    *   For $y \ge -x$: The new x-coordinate is $-x$. So, $y \ge -(-x)$, which means $y \ge x$.

    The inequalities for the reflected region in (a) are:
    $x \ge -5$
    $y < -1$
    $y \ge x$

Part (b): Original Shaded Region and Reflection

1.  **Analyze the original shaded region in (b):**
    *   Line 1: Vertical line segment from (-2, 4) extending downwards. This is the line $x = -2$. Since the shaded region is to the left of this line and the line is solid, the inequality is $x \le -2$.
    *   Line 2: Dashed line passing through (-6, 0) and (-2, 4). The slope is $(4 - 0) / (-2 - (-6)) = 4 / 4 = 1$. The equation of the line is $y - 0 = 1(x - (-6))$, which simplifies to $y = x + 6$. Since the shaded region is below this line and the line is dashed, the inequality is $y < x + 6$.
    *   Line 3: Solid line segment from (-2, 4) to the x-axis at approximately (-2, 0). This is part of the line $y = 0$ (the x-axis). Since the shaded region is above this line and the line is solid, the inequality is $y \ge 0$.

    So, the original inequalities for the shaded region in (b) are:
    $x \le -2$
    $y < x + 6$
    $y \ge 0$

2.  **Reflect the region across the y-axis:**
    Again, a point $(x, y)$ reflects to $(-x, y)$.
    *   For $x \le -2$: The new x-coordinate is $-x$. So, $-x \le -2$, which means $x \ge 2$.
    *   For $y < x + 6$: The new x-coordinate is $-x$. So, $y < (-x) + 6$, which means $y < -x + 6$.
    *   For $y \ge 0$: The y-coordinate remains unchanged. So, $y \ge 0$.

    The inequalities for the reflected region in (b) are:
    $x \ge 2$
    $y < -x + 6$
    $y \ge 0$

Step 3: Final Answer
The problem asks for the linear inequalities that satisfy the image of the shaded region under a reflection in the y-axis for both (a) and (b).

For (a), the original region is defined by $x \le 5$, $y < -1$, and $y \ge -x$. Reflecting across the y-axis transforms these inequalities to $x \ge -5$, $y < -1$, and $y \ge x$.

For (b), the original region is defined by $x \le -2$, $y < x + 6$, and $y \ge 0$. Reflecting across the y-axis transforms these inequalities to $x \ge 2$, $y < -x + 6$, and $y \ge 0$.

FINAL ANSWER:
For (a), the inequalities describing the reflected region are:
$x \ge -5$
$y < -1$
$y \ge x$

For (b), the inequalities describing the reflected region are:
$x \ge 2$

(c) Encik Merisat drives for a distance of 1.725 km in
2.5 minutes with an average speed of 41.4 km h–1.","Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to analyze a speed-time graph of Encik Merisat's car journey. We need to:
(a) Calculate the rate of change of speed (acceleration) for the first 20 seconds.
(b) Calculate the distance traveled at a uniform speed.
(c) Describe the journey over a period of 2.5 minutes.

Non-standard constraints: The journey is within the same housing estate to a friend's house, implying a relatively short distance and moderate speeds, which is consistent with the graph. The time for part (c) is given in minutes and needs to be converted to seconds to match the graph's x-axis.

Step 2: Solution Execution

Part (a): Calculate the rate of change of speed for the first 20 seconds.
The rate of change of speed is acceleration, which is the gradient of the speed-time graph.
The first segment of the graph is from (0, 0) to (40, 15).
The gradient (acceleration) is calculated as:
$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}$

Using the points (0, 0) and (40, 15):
$a = \frac{15 \text{ m s}^{-1} - 0 \text{ m s}^{-1}}{40 \text{ s} - 0 \text{ s}} = \frac{15}{40} \text{ m s}^{-2}$

Now, let's simplify the fraction:
$\frac{15}{40} = \frac{3 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{3}{8}$

To express this as a decimal:
$\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$

So, the rate of change of speed for the first 20 seconds is 0.375 m s⁻². Since the line segment is straight, the acceleration is constant throughout the first 40 seconds, including the first 20 seconds.

Part (b): Calculate the distance traveled at a uniform speed.
Uniform speed occurs when the speed is constant. This is represented by the horizontal line segment on the speed-time graph.
This segment is from (40, 15) to (120, 15).
The uniform speed is 15 m s⁻¹.
The duration of this uniform speed is:
$\Delta t = 120 \text{ s} - 40 \text{ s} = 80 \text{ s}$

The distance traveled at a uniform speed is given by:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = $15 \text{ m s}^{-1} \times 80 \text{ s}$

Let's calculate the distance:
$15 \times 80 = 1200$

So, the distance traveled at a uniform speed is 1200 metres.

Part (c): Describe Encik Merisat's journey for the period of 2.5 minutes.
First, convert 2.5 minutes to seconds:
$2.5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 150 \text{ seconds}$

Now, let's describe the journey in three phases based on the graph segments up to 150 seconds:

Phase 1: From t = 0 s to t = 40 s
The car starts from rest (0 m s⁻¹) and accelerates uniformly to a speed of 15 m s⁻¹ over 40 seconds. The rate of change of speed (acceleration) is 0.375 m s⁻².

Phase 2: From t = 40 s to t = 120 s
The car travels at a constant speed of 15 m s⁻¹ for 80 seconds (from 40 s to 120 s).

Phase 3: From t = 120 s to t = 150 s
The car decelerates uniformly from a speed of 15 m s⁻¹ to 0 m s⁻¹ over 30 seconds (from 120 s to 150 s). The car comes to a stop at the friend's house.

The total duration of the journey described by the graph is 150 seconds, which is exactly 2.5 minutes. Therefore, the description covers the entire journey to the friend's house.

Step 3: Final Answer
The answers to each part are as follows:

(a) The rate of change of speed for the first 20 seconds is 0.375 m s⁻².
(b) The distance traveled at a uniform speed is 1200 metres.
(c) Encik Merisat's journey for the period of 2.5 minutes (150 seconds) can be described as follows:
    - He started from rest and accelerated uniformly for the first 40 seconds, reaching a speed of 15 m s⁻¹.
    - He then maintained a constant speed of 15 m s⁻¹ for the next 80 seconds (from 40 s to 120 s).
    - Finally, he decelerated uniformly for the last 30 seconds (from 120 s to 150 s), coming to a complete stop at his friend's house.

FINAL ANSWER:
(a) The rate of change of speed for the first 20 seconds is 0.375 m s⁻².
(b) The distance travelled at a uniform speed is 1200 metres.
(c) Encik Merisat's journey for the period of 2.5 minutes (150 seconds) involved:
    - Uniform acceleration from 0 to 15 m s⁻¹ over the first 40 seconds.
    - Constant speed of 15 m s⁻¹ for the next 80 seconds (from 40 s to 120 s).

The problem asks us to analyze a distance-time graph for a car and a tour bus. We need to calculate:
(a) The rate of change in distance (speed) of the car for the first 24 minutes.
(b) The value of 't', which represents the time when the car reaches 70 km.
(c) The rate of change in distance (speed) of the car for the last 80 km.

Non-standard constraints: The problem provides visual data in the form of a graph description and specific points, which we need to interpret mathematically.

Step 2: Solution Execution

Part (a): Rate of change in distance of the car for the first 24 minutes.
The rate of change in distance is the speed. For the car, the motion is represented by the green line from O to R. The points on this line are O(0, 0) and R(3, 150).
The first 24 minutes need to be converted to hours: 24 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.4 hours.
We need to find the speed of the car between time 0 and 0.4 hours. Since the line is straight, the rate of change is constant. We can use the coordinates of O(0, 0) and P(0.7, 70) to calculate the speed as it's within the first 0.4 hours. However, the point P is given as (0.7, 70) for the car, which is the same time it reaches 70km. Let's use the points O(0,0) and Q(t, 70) to calculate the speed of the car. Wait, Q is defined as (t, 70) for the car and P is (0.7, 70) for the tour bus.

Let's re-examine the points for the car: O(0,0) and R(3, 150). The speed of the car is the slope of the line OR.
Speed of car = (Change in Distance) / (Change in Time) = (150 km - 0 km) / (3 hours - 0 hours) = 150 km / 3 hours = 50 km/h.
Since the car's motion is a straight line from (0,0) to (3,150), its speed is constant throughout the journey. Therefore, the rate of change in distance for the first 24 minutes (0.4 hours) is 50 km/h.

Part (b): The value of t.
The point Q is on the car's path and has coordinates (t, 70). This means at time 't' hours, the car has traveled 70 km.
We can use the equation of the line for the car, which passes through (0,0) and (3,150).
The slope (speed) of the car is 50 km/h (as calculated above).
The equation of the line is distance = speed × time.
So, distance = 50 * time.
We are given that at time 't', the distance is 70 km.
70 = 50 * t
t = 70 / 50
t = 7/5
t = 1.4 hours.

Let's verify this using the point P for the tour bus which is (0.7, 70). This means at 0.7 hours, the tour bus reached 70km. The car reaches 70km at time 't'. The point Q is labeled on the car's path. The coordinate of Q is given as (t, 70).

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The question states ""Intersection Points: - P: (0.7, 70) - Q: (t, 70)"". This implies P is the intersection of the tour bus and the car at (0.7, 70). And Q is also a point on the car's path at (t, 70). This is contradictory if P and Q are different points. However, looking at the graph description, P is on the tour bus line (A to B) and Q is on the car line (O to R). They are labeled as intersection points. This means P and Q are the same point.
So, P = Q = (0.7, 70).
If P is on the tour bus line and Q is on the car line, and P and Q are the same point, then this is the point where the car and the tour bus meet.
The problem states P is (0.7, 70) and Q is (t, 70). If P and Q are the same point, then t = 0.7 hours.

Let's confirm if P(0.7, 70) lies on the tour bus line from A(0, 150) to B(3, 0).
Slope of AB = (0 - 150) / (3 - 0) = -150 / 3 = -50 km/h.
Equation of line AB: distance - 150 = -50 * (time - 0) => distance = -50 * time + 150.
At time = 0.7 hours, distance = -50 * 0.7 + 150 = -35 + 150 = 115 km.
This means P(0.7, 70) is NOT on the tour bus line. There is a contradiction in the problem statement's ""Intersection Points"" section.

Let's assume P(0.7, 70) is a point on the *car's* path, and Q(t, 70) is also a point on the *car's* path.
If P(0.7, 70) is on the car's path, then its speed is 70 km / 0.7 hours = 100 km/h.
However, the car's path is from O(0,0) to R(3,150). The speed of the car is (150-0)/(3-0) = 50 km/h.
This means P(0.7, 70) is not on the car's path as described by O(0,0) and R(3,150).

Let's assume the ""Intersection Points"" section is providing points that lie on the respective lines, and Q is specifically a point on the car's line.
Car's line passes through O(0,0) and R(3,150). Its equation is distance = 50 * time.
Point Q is given as (t, 70) and lies on the car's path.
So, 70 = 50 * t.
t = 70 / 50 = 1.4 hours.
This value of t is consistent with the car's overall motion.

Now, let's consider P(0.7, 70) as a point on the tour bus line.
Tour bus line passes through A(0, 150) and B(3, 0). Its equation is distance = -50 * time + 150.
At time = 0.7 hours, distance = -50 * 0.7 + 150 = -35 + 150 = 115 km.
This contradicts P being (0.7, 70).

There seems to be a significant inconsistency in the provided ""VISUAL DATA"", specifically with the points P and Q and their stated coordinates and relationship to the lines.

Let's proceed by assuming the fundamental description of the car's motion (O to R) and the tour bus's motion (A to B) are correct, and re-interpret the points P and Q.

Re-interpretation:
- Car: Line from O(0,0) to R(3,150). Speed = 50 km/h. Equation: d = 50t.
- Tour Bus: Line from A(0,150) to B(3,0). Speed = -50 km/h. Equation: d = -50t + 150.

Now consider the given points:
- P: (0.7, 70) - This point is stated to be on the tour bus line. Let's check if it is.
  For tour bus: d = -50 * 0.7 + 150 = -35 + 150 = 115 km. So, P(0.7, 70) is NOT on the tour bus line.
- Q: (t, 70) - This point is stated to be on the car line.
  For car: d = 50 * t. If d = 70, then 70 = 50 * t, which gives t = 1.4 hours. So, Q is (1.4, 70).

Given the inconsistencies, I will proceed with the most mathematically consistent interpretation based on the defined lines for the car and tour bus.

(a) Rate of change in distance of the car for the first 24 minutes.
The car's path is a straight line from (0,0) to (3,150). The rate of change (speed) is constant.
Speed = (150 km - 0 km) / (3 hours - 0 hours) = 150 / 3 = 50 km/h.
This speed applies to the entire journey, including the first 24 minutes (0.4 hours).

(b) The value of t.
The point Q is on the car's path and has coordinates (t, 70). The car's path is described by the equation d = 50t.
Substituting the coordinates of Q: 70 = 50 * t.
t = 70 / 50 = 1.4 hours.

(c) The rate of change in distance, in km h⁻¹, of the car for the last 80 km.
The car travels a total of 150 km. The last 80 km means the distance traveled from (150 - 80) km = 70 km to 150 km.
We already know the car's speed is constant at 50 km/h. The rate of change in distance (speed) is the same for all parts of its journey.
Therefore, the rate of change in distance for the last 80 km is 50 km/h.

Let's double-check if the problem implies different segments of motion for the car. The line O to R is a single straight line, implying constant speed. The phrasing ""rate of change in distance ... for the last 80 km"" might be misleading if the speed is constant.

Let's confirm the time taken for the last 80 km.
The car reaches 70 km at t = 1.4 hours.
The car reaches 150 km at t = 3 hours.
The time taken to cover the distance from 70 km to 150 km (which is 80 km) is 3 hours - 1.4 hours = 1.6 hours.
The speed for this segment is 80 km / 1.6 hours = 50 km/h.
This confirms the speed is constant.

Summary of findings:
(a) Speed of car for the first 24 minutes = 50 km/h.
(b) Value of t = 1.4 hours.
(c) Speed of car for the last 80 km = 50 km/h.

The inconsistencies with points P and Q in the ""Intersection Points"" section of the visual data are noted, but the solution relies on the fundamental definition of the car's motion from O(0,0) to R(3,150).

Step 3: Final Answer
(a) The rate of change in distance of the car for the first 24 minutes is its speed. The car's path is a straight line from (0 km, 0 h) to (150 km, 3 h). The speed is calculated as the slope of this line:
Speed = (150 km - 0 km) / (3 h - 0 h) = 150 km / 3 h = 50 km/h.

(b) The point Q (t, 70) lies on the car's path. The equation for the car's motion is distance = 50 * time.
Substituting the coordinates of Q:
70 = 50 * t
t = 70 / 50
t = 1.4 hours.

(c) The rate of change in distance of the car for the last 80 km is its speed during that segment. Since the car's distance-time graph is a single straight line from O to R, its speed is constant throughout the journey.
Therefore, the rate of change in distance for the last 80 km is also 50 km/h.

FINAL ANSWER:
(a) The rate of change in distance of the car for the first 24 minutes is 50 km h⁻¹.
(b) The value of t is 1.4 hours.

Chapter 7_Q3.png,(a) 8 seconds (b) 17,"Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to analyze a speed-time graph for a car and a motorcycle.
(a) We need to find the duration for which the motorcycle travels at a uniform speed.
(b) We need to find the value of 't' given that the distances traveled by the car and the motorcycle are equal over a period of 't' seconds.

There are no non-standard constraints mentioned beyond the given information.

Step 2: Solution Execution

Part (a): Duration of uniform speed for the motorcycle.
Uniform speed is represented by a horizontal line segment on a speed-time graph.
Looking at the motorcycle's speed-time graph:
- Segment O to P: Speed changes from 0 to 4 m/s over 2 seconds (acceleration).
- Segment P to Q: Speed is constant at 4 m/s from time 2s to 10s. This is a period of uniform speed.
- Segment Q to R: Speed changes from 4 m/s to 10 m/s over (t-10) seconds (acceleration).

The duration of uniform speed for the motorcycle is the time interval of segment PQ.
Duration = Time at Q - Time at P = 10 seconds - 2 seconds = 8 seconds.

Part (b): Value of t when distances are equal.
The distance traveled is the area under the speed-time graph.

Distance traveled by the motorcycle:
This is the area under the green line. We can divide this into three parts corresponding to the segments OP, PQ, and QR.
- Area under OP: This is a triangle with base 2 and height 4. Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 2 * 4 = 4.
- Area under PQ: This is a rectangle with base (10 - 2) = 8 and height 4. Area = base * height = 8 * 4 = 32.
- Area under QR: This is a trapezoid with parallel sides of length 4 (at t=10) and 10 (at t=t), and height (t - 10). Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height = (1/2) * (4 + 10) * (t - 10) = (1/2) * 14 * (t - 10) = 7 * (t - 10) = 7t - 70.

Total distance traveled by the motorcycle = Area(OP) + Area(PQ) + Area(QR)
Distance_motorcycle = 4 + 32 + (7t - 70) = 36 + 7t - 70 = 7t - 34.

Distance traveled by the car:
This is the area under the pink line, which is a straight line from (0, 0) to (t, 10). This forms a triangle.
The base of the triangle is 't' and the height is 10.
Distance_car = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * t * 10 = 5t.

According to the constraint, the distances traveled are the same:
Distance_motorcycle = Distance_car
7t - 34 = 5t

Now, we solve for t:
7t - 5t = 34
2t = 34
t = 34 / 2
t = 17

Let's verify the distances with t=17:
Distance_car = 5 * 17 = 85.
Distance_motorcycle = 7 * 17 - 34 = 119 - 34 = 85.
The distances are indeed the same.

Also, we need to ensure that the point R (t, 10) is consistent with the motorcycle's motion.
For the motorcycle, the segment QR goes from (10, 4) to (t, 10).
The slope of this segment is (10 - 4) / (t - 10) = 6 / (t - 10).
If t = 17, the slope is 6 / (17 - 10) = 6 / 7.
The car's line OR goes from (0, 0) to (t, 10).
The slope of this segment is (10 - 0) / (t - 0) = 10 / t.
If t = 17, the slope is 10 / 17.
The problem statement implies that the point R is common to both lines, which means the lines OR (car) and QR (motorcycle) should meet at R. The setup of the problem provides R as (t, 10) for both.

The question implies that the car's journey ends at time t and the motorcycle's journey also has a point at (t, 10). The distances are compared for the period of t seconds.

Step 3: Final Answer
(a) The motorcycle travels at a uniform speed during the time interval from t=2 seconds to t=10 seconds. The duration is 10 - 2 = 8 seconds.
(b) The distance traveled by the motorcycle is the area under its speed-time graph, which is 4 (triangle OP) + 32 (rectangle PQ) + 7(t-10) (trapezoid QR) = 36 + 7t - 70 = 7t - 34.
The distance traveled by the car is the area under its speed-time graph, which is a triangle with base t and height 10. Area = (1/2) * t * 10 = 5t.
Given that the distances are equal:
7t - 34 = 5t
2t = 34
t = 17 seconds.

(b) interquartile range","## Step 1: Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to calculate the range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation for a given distribution of pupil revision times. We also need to determine the most appropriate measure of dispersion.

## Step 2: Solution Execution

The provided data is:
Time (hours): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10]
Number of pupils: [2, 5, 6, 9, 6, 2, 1, 1]
Total number of pupils: 32

**Part (a): Calculate the range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation.**

**Range:**
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Maximum time = 10 hours
Minimum time = 1 hour
Range = 10 - 1 = 9 hours

**Interquartile Range (IQR):**
First, we need to find the positions of Q1 and Q3.
Total number of pupils (N) = 32.
Q1 position = (N + 1) / 4 = (32 + 1) / 4 = 33 / 4 = 8.25th value
Q3 position = 3 * (N + 1) / 4 = 3 * (32 + 1) / 4 = 99 / 4 = 24.75th value

To find Q1 and Q3, we need the cumulative frequencies:
Time | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency
-----|-----------|---------------------
1    | 2         | 2
2    | 5         | 7
3    | 6         | 13
4    | 9         | 22
5    | 6         | 28
6    | 2         | 30
7    | 1         | 31
10   | 1         | 32

Q1: The 8.25th value falls into the group with cumulative frequency 13, which corresponds to 3 hours. So, Q1 = 3 hours.
Q3: The 24.75th value falls into the group with cumulative frequency 28, which corresponds to 5 hours. So, Q3 = 5 hours.

Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 = 5 - 3 = 2 hours.

**Variance and Standard Deviation:**
We will use the formulas for grouped data as we have frequencies for each time value.
We need Σfx and Σfx².
From the previous tool calls:
Σfx = 125
Σf = 32
Σfx² = 591

Variance (σ²) = (Σfx² / Σf) - (Σfx / Σf)²
Variance = (591 / 32) - (125 / 32)²
Variance = 18.46875 - (3.90625)²
Variance = 18.46875 - 15.2587890625
Variance = 3.2099609375

The tool `calculate_grouped_variance` outputted 3.21, which is consistent.

Standard Deviation (σ) = √Variance
Standard Deviation = √3.2099609375
Standard Deviation ≈ 1.7916365

The tool `calculate_grouped_standard_deviation` outputted 1.79, which is consistent.

**Part (b): State the most appropriate measure of dispersion.**

The distribution is slightly skewed. The median class is [3.5, 4.5) and the mean is 125/32 = 3.90625. Since the mean is slightly higher than the median class, the distribution is slightly positively skewed.

For skewed distributions, the interquartile range (IQR) is generally a more robust measure of dispersion than the range or standard deviation, as it is less affected by outliers.

## Step 3: Final Answer

FINAL ANSWER:
(a)
Range: 9 hours
Interquartile Range (IQR): 2 hours
Variance: 3.21 hours²
Standard Deviation: 1.79 hours

(b)
The most appropriate measure of dispersion to show the time spent on revision by the pupils is the Interquartile Range (IQR) because the distribution is slightly skewed.",correct,2.3551268577575684,6,6,"Full mark (6) awarded.

The method and intermediate calculations (cumulative frequencies, Σfx = 125, Σfx² = 591, N = 32, variance formula) are correct and the conclusion in part (b) that the interquartile range is the most appropriate measure of dispersion for a slightly skewed distribution is also correct.

(b) 5, 3","Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks to calculate the range and the interquartile range (IQR) for two different sets of grouped data.
There are no non-standard constraints.

Step 2: Solution Execution

**Part (a): Diameter of limes**

First, I need to calculate the range. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. In this grouped data, the minimum diameter is 6.0 cm and the maximum diameter is 7.2 cm.

Range = Maximum value - Minimum value
Range = 7.2 cm - 6.0 cm = 1.2 cm

Next, I need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). To find the quartiles for grouped data, I first need to determine the class boundaries and cumulative frequencies.

Class boundaries are typically the midpoints between the upper limit of one class and the lower limit of the next. Assuming the given diameters are the midpoints of the classes:
Midpoints (Diameter): [6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 7.0, 7.2]
Frequencies (Number of limes): [6, 9, 12, 18, 20, 10, 5]

Total number of limes (N) = 6 + 9 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 80

Cumulative Frequencies:
6
6 + 9 = 15
15 + 12 = 27
27 + 18 = 45
45 + 20 = 65
65 + 10 = 75
75 + 5 = 80

Now, let's determine the class boundaries. Since the data is given as discrete values (e.g., 6.0, 6.2), we can assume the intervals are centered around these values. A common approach is to use boundaries halfway between the given values.
For example, between 6.0 and 6.2, the boundary would be 6.1. Between 6.2 and 6.4, the boundary would be 6.3, and so on.
The lower boundary of the first class would be 6.0 - (6.2-6.0)/2 = 5.9.
The upper boundary of the last class would be 7.2 + (7.2-7.0)/2 = 7.3.

Class Boundaries: [5.9, 6.1], [6.1, 6.3], [6.3, 6.5], [6.5, 6.7], [6.7, 6.9], [6.9, 7.1], [7.1, 7.3]

To find Q1, we look for the (N/4)th value. N/4 = 80/4 = 20.
The 20th value falls into the class with cumulative frequency 27, which is the class with midpoint 6.4.
Q1 = L + ((N/4 - CF_prev) / f) * w
where L is the lower boundary of the median class, N is the total frequency, CF_prev is the cumulative frequency of the class before the median class, f is the frequency of the median class, and w is the class width.

For Q1:
The 20th value falls in the class [6.3, 6.5].
L = 6.3
N = 80
N/4 = 20
CF_prev = 15 (cumulative frequency before the class containing Q1)
f = 12 (frequency of the class containing Q1)
w = 0.2 (class width, e.g., 6.5 - 6.3)

Q1 = 6.3 + ((20 - 15) / 12) * 0.2
Q1 = 6.3 + (5 / 12) * 0.2
Q1 = 6.3 + 0.4167 * 0.2
Q1 = 6.3 + 0.0833
Q1 = 6.3833

To find Q3, we look for the (3N/4)th value. 3N/4 = 3 * 80 / 4 = 60.
The 60th value falls into the class with cumulative frequency 65, which is the class with midpoint 6.8.

For Q3:
The 60th value falls in the class [6.7, 6.9].
L = 6.7
N = 80
3N/4 = 60
CF_prev = 45 (cumulative frequency before the class containing Q3)
f = 20 (frequency of the class containing Q3)
w = 0.2 (class width)

Q3 = 6.7 + ((60 - 45) / 20) * 0.2
Q3 = 6.7 + (15 / 20) * 0.2
Q3 = 6.7 + 0.75 * 0.2
Q3 = 6.7 + 0.15
Q3 = 6.85

IQR = Q3 - Q1
IQR = 6.85 - 6.3833
IQR = 0.4667

Let's use the tool to verify the IQR calculation. I will use `calculate_median_class` to find Q1 and Q3. The tool requires class boundaries.
Class boundaries: [[5.9, 6.1], [6.1, 6.3], [6.3, 6.5], [6.5, 6.7], [6.7, 6.9], [6.9, 7.1], [7.1, 7.3]]
Frequencies: [6, 9, 12, 18, 20, 10, 5]

To find Q1, we need the 20th value (N/4).
To find Q3, we need the 60th value (3N/4).

Let's use the `calculate_median_class` to find the class for Q1 and Q3.
For Q1 (20th value):
The 20th value falls in the class [6.3, 6.5] because cumulative frequencies are 6, 15, 27.
L = 6.3, N = 80, N/4 = 20, CF_prev = 15, f = 12, w = 0.2
Q1 = 6.3 + ((20 - 15) / 12) * 0.2 = 6.3 + (5/12) * 0.2 = 6.3 + 0.0833 = 6.3833

For Q3 (60th value):
The 60th value falls in the class [6.7, 6.9] because cumulative frequencies are 45, 65.
L = 6.7, N = 80, 3N/4 = 60, CF_prev = 45, f = 20, w = 0.2
Q3 = 6.7 + ((60 - 45) / 20) * 0.2 = 6.7 + (15/20) * 0.2 = 6.7 + 0.15 = 6.85

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 6.85 - 6.3833 = 0.4667

**Part (b): Age of participants**

First, calculate the range.
Minimum age = 13 years
Maximum age = 18 years

Range = Maximum value - Minimum value
Range = 18 - 13 = 5 years

Next, calculate the IQR.
Midpoints (Age): [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
Frequencies (Number of participants): [12, 18, 21, 20, 21, 8]

Total number of participants (N) = 12 + 18 + 21 + 20 + 21 + 8 = 100

Cumulative Frequencies:
12
12 + 18 = 30
30 + 21 = 51
51 + 20 = 71
71 + 21 = 92
92 + 8 = 100

Class Boundaries:
Lower boundary of first class = 13 - (14-13)/2 = 12.5
Upper boundary of last class = 18 + (18-17)/2 = 18.5
Class Boundaries: [12.5, 13.5], [13.5, 14.5], [14.5, 15.5], [15.5, 16.5], [16.5, 17.5], [17.5, 18.5]
Class width (w) = 1

To find Q1, we look for the (N/4)th value. N/4 = 100/4 = 25.
The 25th value falls into the class with cumulative frequency 30, which is the class with midpoint 14.

For Q1:
The 25th value falls in the class [13.5, 14.5].
L = 13.5
N = 100
N/4 = 25
CF_prev = 12 (cumulative frequency before the class containing Q1)
f = 18 (frequency of the class containing Q1)
w = 1 (class width)

Q1 = 13.5 + ((25 - 12) / 18) * 1
Q1 = 13.5 + (13 / 18) * 1
Q1 = 13.5 + 0.7222
Q1 = 14.2222

To find Q3, we look for the (3N/4)th value. 3N/4 = 3 * 100 / 4 = 75.
The 75th value falls into the class with cumulative frequency 92, which is the class with midpoint 17.

For Q3:
The 75th value falls in the class [16.5, 17.5].
L = 16.5
N = 100
3N/4 = 75
CF_prev = 71 (cumulative frequency before the class containing Q3)
f = 21 (frequency of the class containing Q3)
w = 1 (class width)

Q3 = 16.5 + ((75 - 71) / 21) * 1
Q3 = 16.5 + (4 / 21) * 1

Q3 = 16.6905

For Q1 (25th value):
The 25th value falls in the class [13.5, 14.5].
L = 13.5, N = 100, N/4 = 25, CF_prev = 12, f = 18, w = 1
Q1 = 13.5 + ((25 - 12) / 18) * 1 = 13.5 + 13/18 = 13.5 + 0.7222 = 14.2222

For Q3 (75th value):
The 75th value falls in the class [16.5, 17.5].
L = 16.5, N = 100, 3N/4 = 75, CF_prev = 71, f = 21, w = 1
Q3 = 16.5 + ((75 - 71) / 21) * 1 = 16.5 + 4/21 = 16.5 + 0.1905 = 16.6905

The problem asks us to perform several statistical calculations for two teams, A and B, based on the masses of their players. Specifically, we need to calculate the mean, range, variance, and standard deviation for each team. We also need to assess the appropriateness of the range as a measure of dispersion and determine which team has a greater dispersion from the mean.

There are no non-standard constraints mentioned in the problem.

Step 2: Solution Execution

**Part (a): Calculate the mean, range, variance and standard deviation for the masses of the players in both teams.**

**Team A:**
Masses: 48, 53, 65, 69, 70

*   **Mean:**
    Sum of masses = 48 + 53 + 65 + 69 + 70 = 305
    Number of players = 5
    Mean (A) = 305 / 5 = 61 kg

*   **Range:**
    Range (A) = Maximum mass - Minimum mass = 70 - 48 = 22 kg

*   **Variance:**
    First, calculate the squared differences from the mean:
    (48 - 61)² = (-13)² = 169
    (53 - 61)² = (-8)² = 64
    (65 - 61)² = (4)² = 16
    (69 - 61)² = (8)² = 64
    (70 - 61)² = (9)² = 81
    Sum of squared differences = 169 + 64 + 16 + 64 + 81 = 394
    Variance (A) = Sum of squared differences / Number of players = 394 / 5 = 78.8 kg²

*   **Standard Deviation:**
    Standard Deviation (A) = √Variance (A) = √78.8 ≈ 8.877 kg

**Team B:**
Masses: 45, 47, 68, 70, 75

*   **Mean:**
    Sum of masses = 45 + 47 + 68 + 70 + 75 = 305
    Number of players = 5
    Mean (B) = 305 / 5 = 61 kg

*   **Range:**
    Range (B) = Maximum mass - Minimum mass = 75 - 45 = 30 kg

*   **Variance:**
    First, calculate the squared differences from the mean:
    (45 - 61)² = (-16)² = 256
    (47 - 61)² = (-14)² = 196
    (68 - 61)² = (7)² = 49
    (70 - 61)² = (9)² = 81
    (75 - 61)² = (14)² = 196
    Sum of squared differences = 256 + 196 + 49 + 81 + 196 = 778
    Variance (B) = Sum of squared differences / Number of players = 778 / 5 = 155.6 kg²

*   **Standard Deviation:**
    Standard Deviation (B) = √Variance (B) = √155.6 ≈ 12.474 kg

**Part (b): Is the range appropriate to be used as a measure of dispersion to represent the data above? Justify your answer.**

The range is generally not considered the most appropriate measure of dispersion for a dataset, especially when there are extreme values. In this case, the range for Team A is 22 kg and for Team B is 30 kg. While the range gives a quick idea of the spread, it only considers the two extreme values (minimum and maximum) and ignores all other data points. A single outlier can significantly affect the range, making it a poor representation of the overall dispersion of the data. For instance, if one player's mass was drastically different in either team, the range would change significantly, even if the rest of the data remained the same. Therefore, measures like variance or standard deviation, which consider all data points, are usually preferred.

**Part (c): Determine the mass of which team has a greater dispersion from the mean.**

To determine which team has a greater dispersion from the mean, we should compare their standard deviations (or variances, as the comparison will be the same).

*   Standard Deviation (A) ≈ 8.877 kg
*   Standard Deviation (B) ≈ 12.474 kg

Since the standard deviation of Team B (≈ 12.474 kg) is greater than the standard deviation of Team A (≈ 8.877 kg), Team B has a greater dispersion from the mean.

Alternatively, comparing variances:
*   Variance (A) = 78.8 kg²
*   Variance (B) = 155.6 kg²

Variance (B) is greater than Variance (A), indicating Team B has greater dispersion.

Step 3: Final Answer
The final answer is:

**(a) Team A:**
*   Mean: 61 kg
*   Range: 22 kg
*   Variance: 78.8 kg²
*   Standard Deviation: ≈ 8.877 kg

**Team B:**
*   Mean: 61 kg
*   Range: 30 kg
*   Variance: 155.6 kg²
*   Standard Deviation: ≈ 12.474 kg

**(b)** The range is not appropriate to be used as the sole measure of dispersion because it only considers the extreme values (minimum and maximum) and ignores the distribution of the rest of the data. A single outlier can heavily influence the range.

**(c)** Team B has a greater dispersion from the mean, as indicated by its larger standard deviation (≈ 12.474 kg) compared to Team A (≈ 8.877 kg).",correct,3.456451654434204,7,7,"Full marks (7/7).

- The problem asks for the probability of drawing a letter ""S"" from Box K OR a multiple of 3 from Box L.
- We need to list all possible outcomes when choosing one card from each box.
- There are no non-standard constraints.

Step 2: Solution Execution

First, let's list all possible outcomes.
Box K has letters: S, E, R, I (4 possibilities)
Box L has numbers: 4, 5, 6 (3 possibilities)

The total number of possible outcomes when choosing one card from each box is the product of the number of possibilities for each box: 4 * 3 = 12.

Let's list all possible pairs of outcomes (Letter from Box K, Number from Box L):
(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6)
(E, 4), (E, 5), (E, 6)
(R, 4), (R, 5), (R, 6)
(I, 4), (I, 5), (I, 6)

Now, let's identify the favorable outcomes for the event ""getting a letter 'S' from box K OR a multiple of 3 from box L"".

Event A: Getting a letter ""S"" from Box K.
The outcomes where 'S' is chosen from Box K are: (S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6).
There are 3 outcomes for Event A.

Event B: Getting a multiple of 3 from Box L.
The multiples of 3 in Box L are {6}.
The outcomes where a multiple of 3 is chosen from Box L are: (S, 6), (E, 6), (R, 6), (I, 6).
There are 4 outcomes for Event B.

We are looking for the probability of A OR B, which is P(A ∪ B).
The formula for P(A ∪ B) is P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).

Let's find the outcomes that are in both Event A and Event B (A ∩ B). This means getting 'S' from Box K AND a multiple of 3 from Box L.
The only outcome that satisfies both conditions is (S, 6).
So, there is 1 outcome for (A ∩ B).

Now we can calculate the probabilities:
Total possible outcomes = 12

P(A) = (Number of outcomes in A) / (Total outcomes) = 3 / 12
P(B) = (Number of outcomes in B) / (Total outcomes) = 4 / 12
P(A ∩ B) = (Number of outcomes in A ∩ B) / (Total outcomes) = 1 / 12

Now, apply the formula for P(A ∪ B):
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
P(A ∪ B) = (3/12) + (4/12) - (1/12)
P(A ∪ B) = (3 + 4 - 1) / 12
P(A ∪ B) = 6 / 12
P(A ∪ B) = 1/2

Alternatively, we can count the number of unique favorable outcomes directly from the listed pairs:
Favorable outcomes are those with 'S' from Box K OR a multiple of 3 from Box L.
From Event A: (S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6)
From Event B: (S, 6), (E, 6), (R, 6), (I, 6)

Combining these and removing duplicates:
(S, 4), (S, 5), (S, 6), (E, 6), (R, 6), (I, 6)
There are 6 unique favorable outcomes.

Probability = (Number of unique favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)
Probability = 6 / 12
Probability = 1/2

The solution makes sense in context as we have accounted for all possibilities and used the principle of inclusion-exclusion correctly.

Step 3: Final Answer

- The problem asks us to calculate the total number of RM10 vouchers the Naga Shop needs to prepare.
- The constraints mention that selected cash vouchers are replaced, meaning the number of vouchers in each box remains constant.

Step 2: Solution Execution
The problem involves calculating the expected number of RM10 vouchers based on probabilities from the lucky wheel and the contents of the boxes.

First, let's determine the probabilities associated with the lucky wheel:
- Probability of landing on red (P(Red)) = Number of red sectors / Total sectors = 2 / 6 = 1/3
- Probability of landing on yellow (P(Yellow)) = Number of yellow sectors / Total sectors = 4 / 6 = 2/3

Next, let's determine the probabilities of selecting an RM10 voucher from each box:
- Probability of selecting an RM10 voucher from Box A (P(RM10 | A)) = Number of RM10 vouchers in Box A / Total vouchers in Box A = 5 / (20 + 5) = 5 / 25 = 1/5
- Probability of selecting an RM10 voucher from Box B (P(RM10 | B)) = Number of RM10 vouchers in Box B / Total vouchers in Box B = 20 / (10 + 20) = 20 / 30 = 2/3

Now, we need to find the overall probability of a customer receiving an RM10 voucher. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:
1. The wheel lands on red AND an RM10 voucher is chosen from Box A.
2. The wheel lands on yellow AND an RM10 voucher is chosen from Box B.

The probability of the first case is:
P(Red and RM10 from A) = P(Red) * P(RM10 | A) = (1/3) * (1/5) = 1/15

The probability of the second case is:
P(Yellow and RM10 from B) = P(Yellow) * P(RM10 | B) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9

The total probability of a customer receiving an RM10 voucher is the sum of these probabilities:
P(RM10) = P(Red and RM10 from A) + P(Yellow and RM10 from B)
P(RM10) = 1/15 + 4/9

To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 45:
P(RM10) = (1 * 3) / (15 * 3) + (4 * 5) / (9 * 5)
P(RM10) = 3/45 + 20/45
P(RM10) = 23/45

Finally, we need to calculate the expected number of RM10 vouchers needed for 450 customers.
Expected number of RM10 vouchers = Total customers * P(RM10)
Expected number of RM10 vouchers = 450 * (23/45)

Expected number of RM10 vouchers = (450 / 45) * 23
Expected number of RM10 vouchers = 10 * 23
Expected number of RM10 vouchers = 230

The solution makes sense in context as it uses probabilities to estimate the number of vouchers required.

Chapter 9_Q3.png,"(a) 7/33
(b) 5/33","Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to calculate two probabilities related to the random selection of one badminton club and one bodybuilding club from four different locations (Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, F.T. Labuan, F.T. Putrajaya).

The specific probabilities to calculate are:
(a) The probability that both selected clubs are from Kedah.
(b) The probability that one club is selected from the Federal Territories (Labuan or Putrajaya) and the other from Negeri Sembilan.

There are no non-standard constraints beyond the explicit ones provided. The selection is random, and one club of each type (badminton and bodybuilding) is selected.

Step 2: Solution Execution

First, let's list the total number of clubs for each type in each location:
- Kedah: 14 Badminton, 6 Bodybuilding. Total = 20.
- Negeri Sembilan: 11 Badminton, 2 Bodybuilding. Total = 13.
- F.T. Labuan: 3 Badminton, 2 Bodybuilding. Total = 5.
- F.T. Putrajaya: 5 Badminton, 2 Bodybuilding. Total = 7.

Total number of badminton clubs = 14 + 11 + 3 + 5 = 33
Total number of bodybuilding clubs = 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12
Total number of clubs across all locations = 20 + 13 + 5 + 7 = 45

The problem states ""A badminton club and a bodybuilding club in the four states are selected at random."" This implies that we are selecting one badminton club from the total pool of badminton clubs AND one bodybuilding club from the total pool of bodybuilding clubs.

Let's re-evaluate the problem statement carefully: ""A badminton club and a bodybuilding club in the four states are selected at random."" This could be interpreted in two ways:
1. One badminton club is selected from all badminton clubs, and one bodybuilding club is selected from all bodybuilding clubs.
2. One club is selected from each state, and then we check if one is badminton and the other is bodybuilding.

Given the phrasing and the data provided (number of clubs by type and state), interpretation 1 seems more likely and directly calculable. If it were interpretation 2, the problem would likely be phrased differently and possibly involve conditional probabilities or a different sample space.

Let's proceed with interpretation 1: We select one badminton club from the total of 33 badminton clubs, and one bodybuilding club from the total of 12 bodybuilding clubs.

Total number of ways to select one badminton club = 33
Total number of ways to select one bodybuilding club = 12
Total number of possible pairs of (badminton club, bodybuilding club) = 33 * 12 = 396.

(a) Probability that both clubs selected are from Kedah.
This means we select one badminton club from Kedah AND one bodybuilding club from Kedah.
Number of badminton clubs in Kedah = 14
Number of bodybuilding clubs in Kedah = 6
Number of ways to select one badminton club from Kedah = 14
Number of ways to select one bodybuilding club from Kedah = 6
Number of ways to select both clubs from Kedah = 14 * 6 = 84

The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
P(both from Kedah) = (Number of ways to select badminton from Kedah * Number of ways to select bodybuilding from Kedah) / (Total ways to select badminton * Total ways to select bodybuilding)
P(both from Kedah) = (14 * 6) / (33 * 12)
P(both from Kedah) = 84 / 396

Let's simplify this fraction.
84 / 396
Divide by 12: 7 / 33

(b) Probability that a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.
This phrasing is a bit ambiguous: ""a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.""
It could mean:
   i. One club from *any* Federal Territory (Labuan or Putrajaya) AND one club from Negeri Sembilan.
   ii. One club from F.T. Labuan AND one club from Negeri Sembilan, OR one club from F.T. Putrajaya AND one club from Negeri Sembilan.
   iii. The order matters: (Federal Territory, Negeri Sembilan) OR (Negeri Sembilan, Federal Territory).

Let's consider the most likely interpretation: one club is from the combined Federal Territories (Labuan + Putrajaya) and the other is from Negeri Sembilan.

Federal Territories (Labuan + Putrajaya):
Total Badminton clubs = 3 (Labuan) + 5 (Putrajaya) = 8
Total Bodybuilding clubs = 2 (Labuan) + 2 (Putrajaya) = 4
Total clubs in Federal Territories = 5 + 7 = 12

Negeri Sembilan:
Total Badminton clubs = 11
Total Bodybuilding clubs = 2
Total clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 13

We need to select one badminton club AND one bodybuilding club.
There are two scenarios for part (b):
Scenario 1: Badminton club is from Federal Territories, Bodybuilding club is from Negeri Sembilan.
   - Number of ways = (Badminton clubs in FT) * (Bodybuilding clubs in NS) = 8 * 2 = 16

Scenario 2: Badminton club is from Negeri Sembilan, Bodybuilding club is from Federal Territories.
   - Number of ways = (Badminton clubs in NS) * (Bodybuilding clubs in FT) = 11 * 4 = 44

Total favorable outcomes for part (b) = Scenario 1 + Scenario 2 = 16 + 44 = 60

The total number of ways to select one badminton club and one bodybuilding club is 33 * 12 = 396.

P(one from FT and one from NS) = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes)
P(one from FT and one from NS) = 60 / 396

Let's simplify this fraction.
60 / 396
Divide by 12: 5 / 33

Let's double check the interpretation of ""a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.""
If ""respectively"" implies order, it could mean the first selection is from FT and the second from NS, or vice-versa. However, since we're selecting a pair of clubs (one badminton, one bodybuilding), the order of selection of the *locations* might not matter as much as ensuring the *types* of clubs are satisfied.

Let's consider the case where ""Federal Territories"" refers to *either* Labuan OR Putrajaya, and the phrasing ""respectively"" implies that the two selected clubs must come from distinct categories of locations: (FT, NS).

Alternative interpretation for (b):
The problem states ""A badminton club and a bodybuilding club... are selected at random.""
This means we are picking one badminton and one bodybuilding.
The question for (b) states: ""a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.""
This could imply that one of the *selected clubs* is from the Federal Territories, and the *other selected club* is from Negeri Sembilan.

Let's break down the Federal Territories:
FT Labuan: 3 Badminton, 2 Bodybuilding
FT Putrajaya: 5 Badminton, 2 Bodybuilding

Negeri Sembilan: 11 Badminton, 2 Bodybuilding

Total Badminton Clubs = 33
Total Bodybuilding Clubs = 12
Total Pairs = 33 * 12 = 396

We need one club from {FT Labuan, FT Putrajaya} and one club from {Negeri Sembilan}.
The selected pair must be (Badminton, Bodybuilding).

Case 1: Badminton club is from FT, Bodybuilding club is from Negeri Sembilan.
   - Badminton from FT: 3 (Labuan) + 5 (Putrajaya) = 8 ways.
   - Bodybuilding from Negeri Sembilan: 2 ways.
   - Number of pairs = 8 * 2 = 16.

Case 2: Badminton club is from Negeri Sembilan, Bodybuilding club is from FT.
   - Badminton from Negeri Sembilan: 11 ways.
   - Bodybuilding from FT: 2 (Labuan) + 2 (Putrajaya) = 4 ways.
   - Number of pairs = 11 * 4 = 44.

Total favorable outcomes = 16 + 44 = 60.
Probability = 60 / 396.
Simplifying: 60/396 = 5/33.

This interpretation seems consistent with how such probability problems are usually structured, ensuring the chosen pair meets the type criteria and the location criteria.

Let's re-read the question very carefully: ""A badminton club and a bodybuilding club in the four states are selected at random.""
This implies the sample space is the set of all possible pairs of (one badminton club, one bodybuilding club).

Total Badminton Clubs = 33
Total Bodybuilding Clubs = 12
Total possible pairs = 33 * 12 = 396.

(a) both clubs selected are from Kedah.
This means: (Badminton club from Kedah) AND (Bodybuilding club from Kedah).
Number of Badminton clubs in Kedah = 14.
Number of Bodybuilding clubs in Kedah = 6.
Number of favorable pairs = 14 * 6 = 84.
Probability (a) = 84 / 396 = 7 / 33. (This matches our previous calculation).

(b) a club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.
This phrasing is tricky. ""a club is selected each from X and Y respectively"".
Does it mean:
   i) The badminton club is from FT, and the bodybuilding club is from NS.
   ii) The badminton club is from NS, and the bodybuilding club is from FT.
   iii) The first club selected (regardless of type) is from FT, and the second club selected (regardless of type) is from NS. (This contradicts the ""one badminton and one bodybuilding"" constraint if not handled carefully).
   iv) The pair of selected clubs must include one from FT and one from NS. This is what we calculated.

Let's assume interpretation (iv) as it directly uses the counts of badminton and bodybuilding clubs within the specified regions. ""Federal Territories"" refers to the union of F.T. Labuan and F.T. Putrajaya.

Total Badminton Clubs in Federal Territories = 3 (Labuan) + 5 (Putrajaya) = 8
Total Bodybuilding Clubs in Federal Territories = 2 (Labuan) + 2 (Putrajaya) = 4

Total Badminton Clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 11
Total Bodybuilding Clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 2

We are selecting one Badminton club and one Bodybuilding club.
We want one club from FT and one from NS.

Case 1: Badminton club from FT, Bodybuilding club from NS.
Number of ways = (Number of Badminton clubs in FT) * (Number of Bodybuilding clubs in NS)
Number of ways = 8 * 2 = 16.

Case 2: Badminton club from NS, Bodybuilding club from FT.
Number of ways = (Number of Badminton clubs in NS) * (Number of Bodybuilding clubs in FT)
Number of ways = 11 * 4 = 44.

Total favorable outcomes for (b) = 16 + 44 = 60.
Total possible outcomes = 33 * 12 = 396.
Probability (b) = 60 / 396 = 5 / 33.

This interpretation seems robust. The word ""respectively"" can sometimes imply order, but in the context of a pair of selections where the types are fixed (one badminton, one bodybuilding), it's more likely referring to the distinct origins of the two clubs in the pair.

Let's consider the total number of clubs for each state again for clarity.
Kedah: B=14, BB=6, T=20
NS: B=11, BB=2, T=13
FT Labuan: B=3, BB=2, T=5
FT Putrajaya: B=5, BB=2, T=7

Total B = 14+11+3+5 = 33
Total BB = 6+2+2+2 = 12
Total clubs = 20+13+5+7 = 45.

The problem states ""A badminton club and a bodybuilding club... are selected at random.""
This means our sample space is pairs (b_i, bb_j) where b_i is any badminton club and bb_j is any bodybuilding club.
Total sample space size = (Total Badminton Clubs) * (Total Bodybuilding Clubs) = 33 * 12 = 396.

(a) Both clubs selected are from Kedah.
This means we select a pair (b_k, bb_l) where b_k is a badminton club from Kedah, and bb_l is a bodybuilding club from Kedah.
Number of badminton clubs in Kedah = 14.
Number of bodybuilding clubs in Kedah = 6.
Number of favorable outcomes = 14 * 6 = 84.
P(a) = 84 / 396.
Simplify: 84/12 = 7, 396/12 = 33. So, P(a) = 7/33.

(b) A club is selected each from the Federal Territories and Negeri Sembilan respectively.
This means the selected pair (b_i, bb_j) must satisfy that one club is from FT and the other is from NS.

Let FT_B be the number of badminton clubs in Federal Territories (Labuan + Putrajaya) = 3 + 5 = 8.
Let FT_BB be the number of bodybuilding clubs in Federal Territories (Labuan + Putrajaya) = 2 + 2 = 4.
Let NS_B be the number of badminton clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 11.
Let NS_BB be the number of bodybuilding clubs in Negeri Sembilan = 2.

We need to form a pair (b_i, bb_j) such that one club is from FT and the other is from NS.

Possibility 1: Badminton club is from FT, Bodybuilding club is from NS.
Number of ways = FT_B * NS_BB = 8 * 2 = 16.

Possibility 2: Badminton club is from NS, Bodybuilding club is from FT.
Number of ways = NS_B * FT_BB = 11 * 4 = 44.

Total number of favorable outcomes for (b) = 16 + 44 = 60.
P(b) = 60 / 396.
Simplify: 60/12 = 5, 396/12 = 33. So, P(b) = 5/33.

The calculations seem consistent and the interpretation of the problem statement leads to these results.

income is more than the total expenses. This has
improved Encik Nabil’s liquidity","Step 1: Problem Understanding
The problem asks to create a monthly personal financial plan for Encik Nabil and comment on the resulting surplus or deficit.

The income sources are:
- Net salary: RM3,800
- Commission: RM450
- Rental income: RM600

The expenses are listed as:
- Housing loan instalment (1): RM800
- Housing loan instalment (2): RM500
- Food expenses: RM900
- Utility payments: RM150
- Toll and petrol expenses: RM200
- Internet service subscription: RM100
- Eat at a luxury restaurant: RM400
- Insurance expenses: RM350

The constraint is that Encik Nabil saves 10% of his salary.

Step 2: Solution Execution

First, calculate Encik Nabil's total monthly income.
Total Income = Net Salary + Commission + Rental Income
Total Income = RM3,800 + RM450 + RM600 = RM4,850

Next, calculate the fixed monthly savings.
Savings = 10% of Net Salary
Savings = 0.10 * RM3,800 = RM380

Now, calculate the total monthly expenses.
Total Expenses = Housing loan (1) + Housing loan (2) + Food + Utilities + Toll/Petrol + Internet + Luxury Dining + Insurance
Total Expenses = RM800 + RM500 + RM900 + RM150 + RM200 + RM100 + RM400 + RM350 = RM3,500

Now, let's create the financial plan and determine the surplus or deficit.
Financial Plan:

**Income:**
*   Net Salary: RM3,800
*   Commission: RM450
*   Rental Income: RM600
*   **Total Income: RM4,850**

**Expenses:**
*   Savings (10% of Salary): RM380
*   Housing loan instalment (1): RM800
*   Housing loan instalment (2): RM500
*   Food expenses: RM900
*   Utility payments: RM150
*   Toll and petrol expenses: RM200
*   Internet service subscription: RM100
*   Eat at a luxury restaurant: RM400
*   Insurance expenses: RM350
*   **Total Expenses (including savings): RM3,780**

Now, calculate the surplus or deficit.
Surplus/Deficit = Total Income - Total Expenses (including savings)
Surplus/Deficit = RM4,850 - RM3,780 = RM1,070

This indicates a surplus.

Comments on Surplus/Deficit:
Encik Nabil is projected to have a monthly surplus of RM1,070 based on this financial plan. This surplus can be allocated towards additional savings, investments, or discretionary spending. However, it's important to note that the ""Eat at a luxury restaurant"" expense of RM400 is a discretionary expense and could be reduced if needed to increase the surplus further or cover unexpected costs. The food expenses (RM900) are also quite high and might be an area for potential reduction.
