Chapter 1_Q1.png,"No. The pizza with diameter of 30 cm is more
worth it.",4,Variation,English,yes,4,"Read the diagram: diameters and prices are
- small: diameter 15 cm, price RM12
- medium: diameter 23 cm, price RM25
- large: diameter 30 cm, price RM35

Step 1 — find radii
- small r = 15/2 = 7.5 cm
- medium r = 23/2 = 11.5 cm
- large r = 30/2 = 15 cm

Step 2 — surface areas A = π r^2
- small: A = π(7.5)^2 = 56.25π ≈ 176.715 cm^2
- medium: A = π(11.5)^2 = 132.25π ≈ 415.480 cm^2
- large: A = π(15)^2 = 225π ≈ 706.858 cm^2

Step 3 — price per unit area (RM per cm^2) = price / area
- small: 12 / (56.25π) ≈ 12 / 176.715 ≈ 0.0679 RM/cm^2
- medium: 25 / (132.25π) ≈ 25 / 415.480 ≈ 0.0602 RM/cm^2
- large: 35 / (225π) ≈ 35 / 706.858 ≈ 0.0496 RM/cm^2

Step 4 — conclusion
If price varied directly with surface area, the ratio price/area would be the same for all sizes. The ratios above are different, so price does not vary directly as area. The best value (lowest RM per cm^2) is the large 30 cm pizza, so the 30 cm pizza is worth buying.",1332,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

Given A = 88 when r = 3.5 and s = 8:

Thus A = (22/7) r s.

(a) For r = 5 and s = 9.8:
A = (22/7) × 5 × 9.8 = 154 cm².

(b) With r fixed, A is directly proportional to s (A = (22/7) r s). If the slant height decreases by Δs (a negative number), the change in area is
ΔA = (22/7) r Δs.
In other words the area decreases in the same proportion (or by the same percentage) as the slant height. For example, if s decreases by 1 cm, A decreases by (22/7) r cm².",1169,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

(a) Is the distribution symmetrical? Give your reason.
- No. The histogram has most observations at the higher glucose levels (right side) and a long tail toward lower values (left side). That is, the distribution is not symmetric; it is negatively skewed (skewed to the left).

(b) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the blood glucose readings.
Step 1 — midpoints of each class:
- 2.95–3.95 midpoint = 3.45
- 3.95–4.95 midpoint = 4.45
- 4.95–5.95 midpoint = 5.45
- 5.95–6.95 midpoint = 6.45
- 6.95–7.95 midpoint = 7.45
- 7.95–8.95 midpoint = 8.45

(c) Compare the standard deviation of the readings between 6.0 mmol/L and 8.9 mmol/L with the standard deviation in (b). Justify your answer.

- The interval 6.0–8.9 mmol/L corresponds to the classes 5.95–6.95, 6.95–7.95 and 7.95–8.95 (midpoints 6.45, 7.45, 8.45) with frequencies 25, 40, 30.
- Subset N_sub = 25+40+30 = 95.
- Sum f·x for subset = 25·6.45 + 40·7.45 + 30·8.45 = 161.25 + 298.00 + 253.50 = 712.75.
- Mean_sub = 712.75 / 95 = 7.5026 ≈ 7.50 mmol/L.
- Sum f·x^2 for subset = 25·6.45^2 + 40·7.45^2 + 30·8.45^2 = 1040.0625 + 2220.10 + 2142.075 = 5402.2375.
- E[x^2]_sub = 5402.2375 / 95 = 56.86566.
- variance_sub = 56.86566 − (7.5026)^2 ≈ 56.86566 − 56.2890 = 0.5767.
- sd_sub = sqrt(0.5767) ≈ 0.76 mmol/L (approximately).

Comparison and justification:
- The standard deviation for the subset (≈ 0.76 mmol/L) is smaller than the overall standard deviation (≈ 1.09 mmol/L).
- Reason: restricting to the narrower range 6.0–8.9 removes the low-value tail and the more widely spread values, so the readings in this restricted range are closer together and therefore have a smaller spread (smaller standard deviation).",4897,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

Grouped Data",English,yes,7,"Step 1 — read the grouped data and take class midpoints
- Classes and midpoints: 120–134: m1 = 127; 135–149: m2 = 142; 150–164: m3 = 157; 165–179: m4 = 172
- Frequencies before: fB = [4, 7, 8, 6], nB = 25
- Frequencies after: fA = [9, 8, 7, 1], nA = 25

Step 2 — compute the mean (grouped data formula mean = Σ(f·m)/n)

Before:
ΣfBm = 4·127 + 7·142 + 8·157 + 6·172 = 508 + 994 + 1256 + 1032 = 3790
mean_before = 3790 / 25 = 151.6 mmHg

After:
ΣfAm = 9·127 + 8·142 + 7·157 + 1·172 = 1143 + 1136 + 1099 + 172 = 3550
mean_after = 3550 / 25 = 142.0 mmHg

Step 3 — compute the standard deviation (use grouped-data variance formula)
Compute Σ(f·m^2) for each case.

Before:
127^2·4 = 16129·4 = 64516
142^2·7 = 20164·7 = 141148
157^2·8 = 24649·8 = 197192
172^2·6 = 29584·6 = 177504
Σf m^2 = 580360

Variance (using sample formula, divisor n−1):
s_B^2 = [Σ(f m^2) − n·mean^2] / (n−1)
s_B^2 = [580360 − 25·(151.6)^2] / 24 = [580360 − 574564] / 24 = 5796 / 24 = 241.5
s_B = sqrt(241.5) ≈ 15.54 mmHg

After:
127^2·9 = 16129·9 = 145161
142^2·8 = 20164·8 = 161312
157^2·7 = 24649·7 = 172543
172^2·1 = 29584·1 = 29584
Σf m^2 = 508600

s_A^2 = [508600 − 25·(142)^2] / 24 = [508600 − 504100] / 24 = 4500 / 24 = 187.5
s_A = sqrt(187.5) ≈ 13.69 mmHg

(If one uses the population divisor n instead, the standard deviations would be ≈15.23 mmHg before and ≈13.42 mmHg after. Above I used n−1.)

Step 4 — conclusion (interpretation)
- Mean before = 151.6 mmHg, mean after = 142.0 mmHg: the average systolic blood pressure fell by 9.6 mmHg after the dose.
- Standard deviation decreased slightly (≈15.5 → 13.7 mmHg), so readings are a bit less spread out after the medicine.

Conclusion: The medicine appears effective in lowering the group’s systolic blood pressure (mean decreased noticeably). A formal significance test would be needed to confirm statistical significance, but the observed drop in mean (~9.6 mmHg) indicates an effect.",2825,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

Let the origin x = 0 be at the midspan (the lowest point of the cable) and let y measure the vertical distance from the deck up to the cable (in metres). The cable is symmetric, so model it by a parabola of the form
y = ax^2 + c.

At the midspan (x = 0) the shortest distance from the cable to the deck is 5 m, so c = 5 and
y = ax^2 + 5.

The half-span from the midspan to a tower is 600/2 = 300 m. At x = 300 the cable is 35 m above the deck, so
35 = a(300)^2 + 5.
Solve for a:
30 = a · 90000
a = 30/90000 = 1/3000.

Thus the cable arc is
y = (1/3000) x^2 + 5  (y and x in metres), for −300 ≤ x ≤ 300.

Suspender spacing:
The half-span is 300 m. If suspenders are placed every 20 m along each side, the number of equal 20 m intervals on one side is
300/20 = 15.
So there are 15 suspenders on each side, giving 15 + 15 = 30 suspenders in total.

(If instead a suspender is placed exactly at the midspan as well, counting that center one once yields 31 total; the standard interpretation counting even spacing out from the midspan gives 30 total.)",1946,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini

(b) Exponential model. Temperature will not

shown in the linear model.",6,Mathematical Modeling,English,yes,6,"First restate the data:
- t (s): 0, 40, 80, 120
- T (°C): 200, 140, 100, 75

(a) Identify which graph is which
- C is the linear model (straight line).
- A is the quadratic model (parabola that turns up at larger t).
- B is the exponential model (smooth decay approaching a horizontal asymptote).

(Reason: C is visually a straight line. A has the shape of a parabola (it flattens and then turns upward). B decays and levels off toward a horizontal asymptote, the characteristic shape of an exponential approach.)

(b) Which model best describes the cooling for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250? Explain why the others do not fit.

Step 1 — look at how the cooling rate changes from the data:
- slope 0→40: (140 − 200)/(40 − 0) = −60/40 = −1.50 °C/s
- slope 40→80: (100 − 140)/(80 − 40) = −40/40 = −1.00 °C/s
- slope 80→120: (75 − 100)/(120 − 80) = −25/40 = −0.625 °C/s

The magnitude of the cooling rate is decreasing with time (|slope| gets smaller). That is exactly what exponential (Newton’s law of cooling) predicts: the temperature falls rapidly at first, then more slowly, approaching the ambient (room) temperature asymptotically.

Step 2 — why linear is bad
- A linear model implies a constant rate of temperature change. The data show a decreasing rate, so a straight line does not match the curvature of the points.
- If you used a linear fit based on the data (for example using the average slope from 0 to 120: (75−200)/120 ≈ −1.0417 °C/s), it would predict T(250) ≈ 200 − 1.0417·250 ≈ −60 °C, which is physically unrealistic (temperature would go well below room temperature).

Step 3 — why quadratic is bad
- A quadratic that fits the first part of the data will eventually turn upward (as seen in graph A), predicting that the sample warms again for large t. That contradicts the physics of cooling to ambient temperature and the observed monotone decrease toward a limiting temperature.

Step 4 — why exponential is best
- Exponential decay (graph B) matches the decreasing rate of cooling and approaches a horizontal asymptote (room temperature). It remains above the ambient temperature and does not go negative or start rising again, so it is the physically reasonable model for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250.

Conclusion:
- Best model for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 is the exponential model B. Linear model C is ruled out because it gives a constant rate and predicts unrealistic negative temperatures; quadratic model A is ruled out because it eventually rises (predicts warming), which is not physically appropriate for cooling.",2201,SUCCESS,gpt-5-mini
Chapter 8_Q3.png,(a) T = ?(6.5 × 10?3) x + 30,3,Mathematical Modeling,English,yes,3,"Read-off and reasoning:
- Given rate of change = −6.5°C per 1000 m, so slope per metre = −6.5/1000 = −0.0065 °C/m.
- Temperature at sea level (x = 0 m) is T(0) = 30°C, so y-intercept = 30.

Form the linear function using T(x) = T(0) + (rate per m)·x:
T(x) = 30 + (−0.0065)x = 30 − 0.0065x.

Check (optional): x = 1000 → T = 30 − 6.5 = 23.5°C; x = 2000 → 30 − 13 = 17°C; x = 3000 → 30 − 19.5 = 10.5°C (matches diagram).
