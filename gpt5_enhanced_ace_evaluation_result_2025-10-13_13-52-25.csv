Chapter 1_Q1.png,(a) A = x2 + 25x + 100                 (b) x2 + 25x – 150 = 0,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Rectangle (area problem / simple geometric diagram).
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Length = (x + 20) m
  - Width = (x + 5) m
  - Area A (in m^2) is the product of length and width: A = (x + 20)(x + 5)

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Part (a) asks for a function for the area A (in m^2) in terms of x.
- Part (b) gives A = 250 m^2 and asks for a quadratic equation in x in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Area function: A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5).
- For part (b): set (x + 20)(x + 5) = 250 and rearrange to standard quadratic form.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Expand the area function:
   A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5)
         = x^2 + 5x + 20x + 100
         = x^2 + 25x + 100  (units: m^2)

2. For A = 250 m^2, set up the equation:
   x^2 + 25x + 100 = 250

3. Subtract 250 from both sides to get standard form:
   x^2 + 25x + 100 - 250 = 0
   x^2 + 25x - 150 = 0

4. (Optional: solve the quadratic to find x)
   Discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac = 25^2 - 4(1)(-150) = 625 + 600 = 1225
   sqrt(D) = 35
   Roots: x = [-25 ± 35]/2
     x1 = (-25 + 35)/2 = 10/2 = 5
     x2 = (-25 - 35)/2 = -60/2 = -30
   Physical consideration: x must make dimensions positive.
     If x = -30 → width x+5 = -25 (invalid)
     If x = 5 → width x+5 = 10 m, length x+20 = 25 m (valid)

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) Area function: A(x) = x^2 + 25x + 100 (m^2).
- (b) Quadratic equation when A = 250 m^2: x^2 + 25x - 150 = 0.
- (Optional solved value) The physically valid solution is x = 5 (so length = 25 m and width = 10 m, area = 250 m^2).

- Type of diagram: Graph of a quadratic function (parabola).
- Given function: f(x) = −x^2 + 6x − 5.
- Features extracted from the diagram:
  - Origin O at (0,0).
  - A and B are intersection points of a horizontal line AB (parallel to the x-axis) with the parabola.
  - A lies on the y-axis (so x = 0 in the diagram).
  - The parabola opens downward (coefficient of x^2 is negative), so it has a maximum (vertex) P.
  - Labeled point P is the maximum (vertex) of the parabola.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Determine:
  (a) coordinates of point A,
  (b) equation of the axis of symmetry,
  (c) coordinates of point B,
  (d) coordinates of the maximum point P.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- A is on the y-axis, so x = 0. Its y-coordinate is f(0).
- Line AB is horizontal and passes through A, so its y-value is y = f(0). B is the other solution to f(x) = f(0).
- Axis of symmetry for a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c is x = −b/(2a). Here a = −1, b = 6.
- The maximum point P is at x = −b/(2a); its y-coordinate is f(x) evaluated at that x.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) Coordinates of A:
- f(0) = −(0)^2 + 6·0 − 5 = −5.
- Therefore A = (0, −5).

(b) Equation of the axis of symmetry:
- x-coordinate of vertex = −b/(2a) = −6/(2·(−1)) = −6/(−2) = 3.
- Therefore axis of symmetry: x = 3.

(c) Coordinates of B:
- B is the other intersection of the horizontal line y = −5 with the parabola.
- Solve f(x) = −5:
  −x^2 + 6x − 5 = −5
  ⇒ −x^2 + 6x = 0
  ⇒ x(−x + 6) = 0
  ⇒ x = 0 or x = 6.
- x = 0 corresponds to A; the other intersection is x = 6, so B = (6, −5).

(d) Coordinates of the maximum point P:
- x-coordinate = 3 (from axis).
- y-coordinate f(3) = −(3)^2 + 6·3 − 5 = −9 + 18 − 5 = 4.
- Therefore P = (3, 4).

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) A = (0, −5)
- (b) Axis of symmetry: x = 3
- (c) B = (6, −5)
- (d) Maximum point P = (3, 4)

Chapter 1_Q3.png,20 cm,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: Geometric figures (an isosceles triangle and a square).
- Extracted features:
  - Diagram 1 (isosceles triangle):
    - Base = 4y cm.
    - Height (altitude from apex to base) = (y + 5) cm.
    - Tick marks on the two equal sides indicate they are congruent; the altitude bisects the base (so each half of the base = (4y)/2 = 2y).
  - Diagram 2 (square):
    - Side length = y cm (all four sides equal).
- Given relation from text: Area of the triangle is more than the area of the square by 39 cm^2.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Find the difference in perimeter between the triangle and the square (report in cm).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Area of triangle A_tri = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (4y) * (y + 5) = 2y(y + 5).
- Area of square A_sq = y^2.
- Given: A_tri − A_sq = 39, so 2y(y + 5) − y^2 = 39.
- Perimeters:
  - Perimeter of square P_sq = 4y.
  - Perimeter of triangle P_tri = base + 2*(equal side length).
    - Equal side length s = sqrt((half-base)^2 + (height)^2) = sqrt((2y)^2 + (y + 5)^2).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Compute area equation:
   2y(y + 5) − y^2 = 39
   Expand: 2y^2 + 10y − y^2 = 39
   Simplify: y^2 + 10y − 39 = 0

2) Solve the quadratic y^2 + 10y − 39 = 0.
   Discriminant D = 10^2 − 4(1)(−39) = 100 + 156 = 256
   sqrt(D) = 16
   Solutions: y = [−10 ± 16]/2
   y1 = (6)/2 = 3
   y2 = (−26)/2 = −13 (discard, side length must be positive)
   So y = 3 cm.

3) Perimeter of square:
   P_sq = 4y = 4(3) = 12 cm.

4) Equal side length of triangle:
   half-base = 2y = 6 cm
   height = y + 5 = 8 cm
   s = sqrt((6)^2 + (8)^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10 cm

5) Perimeter of triangle:
   P_tri = base + 2s = 4y + 2s = 12 + 2(10) = 12 + 20 = 32 cm.

6) Difference in perimeter:
   P_tri − P_sq = 32 − 12 = 20 cm.
   (Absolute difference = 20 cm.)

Step 5: Final Answer.
- The difference in perimeter between the triangle and the square is 20 cm.

  - Total number of visitors in January is given as 20202 in base five (written 20202_5).
  - January has 31 days and the zoo opens every day.
  - The required answer must be given in base five.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Find the average number of visitors per day in January (total divided by 31) and give that average in base five.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Let N5 = 20202_5 denote the total in base 5.
- Convert N5 to decimal: N10 = 2·5^4 + 0·5^3 + 2·5^2 + 0·5 + 2.
- Compute average in decimal: A10 = N10 / 31.
- Convert A10 back to base 5 to give the final answer.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Convert 20202_5 to decimal:
   - 5^4 = 625, 5^2 = 25.
   - N10 = 2·625 + 0·125 + 2·25 + 0·5 + 2·1
         = 1250 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 2

2) Compute average per day in decimal:
   - A10 = 1302 / 31.
   - 31 × 42 = 1302, so A10 = 42.

3) Convert 42 (decimal) to base five:
   - 5^2 = 25. 42 ÷ 25 = 1 remainder 17.
   - 17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2.

  - A diagonal from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, dividing the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.
  - Right-angle marks at the top-left and bottom-right corners (indicating rectangle).
  - The shaded (children’s) playground is the triangle occupying the top-left half of the rectangle.
  - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 3300_4 metres (notation indicates the number 3300 in base 4).

- Goal: Find the area (in square metres) of the children’s playground (the shaded triangular half of the rectangle), given the rectangle’s perimeter 3300_4 and the rectangle’s top side 80 m and vertical side x m.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Perimeter of rectangle (decimal) P = 2*(length + width) = 2*(80 + x).
- Given perimeter in base 4: 3300_4. Convert 3300_4 to decimal.
  - 3300_4 = 3*4^3 + 3*4^2 + 0*4 + 0 = 3*64 + 3*16 = 192 + 48 = 240 (decimal).
- Set equation: 2*(80 + x) = 240. Solve for x.
- Area of the triangular children’s playground = (1/2) * (length) * (width) = (1/2) * 80 * x.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Convert perimeter from base 4 to decimal:
   - 3300_4 = 3*4^3 + 3*4^2 + 0*4 + 0
   - 4^3 = 64, 4^2 = 16
   - 3300_4 = 3*64 + 3*16 = 192 + 48 = 240 (metres).
2. Use perimeter formula for rectangle:
   - 2*(80 + x) = 240
   - Divide both sides by 2: 80 + x = 120
   - Solve for x: x = 120 - 80 = 40 (metres).
3. Compute area of the triangular children’s playground:
   - Area_triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 80 * 40

  - Initial single cell labeled ""Cell A"" (day 0).
  - On the first day two new cells are produced.
  - Every cell produces two new cells on subsequent days, so the number of new cells produced on day t is P(t) = 2^t (t = number of days).

- Goal (b): Find the day t when the number of new cells equals 2,048 (i.e., solve P(t) = 2048 for t).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Use the given formula P(t) = 2^t.
- (a) Compute P(8) = 2^8.
- (b) Solve 2^t = 2048 for t.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a)
- P(8) = 2^8.
- 2^8 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 256.
- Therefore, the number of new cells produced on the 8th day is 256.

- Type of diagram: Arrangement of semicircles nested inside a larger semicircle (geometric diagram of semicircles).
- Key features extracted from the diagram and text:
  - The largest semicircle has radius 32 cm.
  - The semicircles are arranged so each subsequent semicircle has half the radius of the previous one (visible halving pattern in the picture).
  - We therefore label radii r_n = 32 · (1/2)^n for n = 0,1,2,... where n = 0 corresponds to the largest (first) semicircle.
  - Perimeter of a semicircle (including its diameter) = (curved arc length) + (diameter) = πr + 2r = r(π + 2).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Calculate and list the perimeters of the first four semicircles, in terms of π.
- (b) Show the general formula given in the question: perimeters = 2^{6−n}(π + 2); n = 0,1,2,3,4,... (we will reconcile indexing).
- (c) Calculate the perimeter, in cm, of the 8th semicircle.
- Clarification/assumption: I take ""first semicircle"" as n = 0 (largest), so the 8th semicircle corresponds to n = 7. If a different indexing is intended (first = n = 1), the result can be shifted accordingly; I will state this explicitly in the final step.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Radii: r_n = 32 · 2^{-n}, n = 0,1,2,...
- Perimeter of nth semicircle: P_n = r_n(π + 2) = 32·2^{-n}(π + 2).
- Simplify the factor 32 = 2^5, so P_n = 2^{5−n}(π + 2).
- To match the form 2^{6−n}(π + 2) given in the question, note that 2^{6−n}(π + 2) = 2 · 2^{5−n}(π + 2). Thus the two forms differ by a factor of 2 unless the question’s index n is shifted by 1. If we define m = n + 1, then P_m = 2^{6−m}(π + 2). So the given form is equivalent to P with a shifted index; the formula 2^{5−n}(π+2) is the direct expression when n=0 denotes the largest semicircle.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(a) First four semicircles (using n = 0,1,2,3)
- n = 0 (1st semicircle): r0 = 32 · 2^0 = 32.
  P0 = 32(π + 2) = 32π + 64.
- n = 1 (2nd semicircle): r1 = 32 · 2^{-1} = 16.
  P1 = 16(π + 2) = 16π + 32.
- n = 2 (3rd semicircle): r2 = 32 · 2^{-2} = 8.
  P2 = 8(π + 2) = 8π + 16.
- n = 3 (4th semicircle): r3 = 32 · 2^{-3} = 4.
  P3 = 4(π + 2) = 4π + 8.

(b) Generalisation
- From P_n = r_n(π + 2) and r_n = 32·2^{-n} = 2^5·2^{-n} we get
  P_n = 2^{5−n}(π + 2).
- If one prefers the form in the question, 2^{6−n}(π + 2), this is the same formula with an index shift: let m = n + 1; then P_m = 2^{6−m}(π + 2). Thus the given expression is consistent once the indexing convention is fixed (largest semicircle = m = 1).

(c) Perimeter of the 8th semicircle
- Using the convention first = n = 0 so 8th → n = 7:
  P_7 = 32 · 2^{-7}(π + 2) = 32/128 · (π + 2) = (1/4)(π + 2).
- Exact form: P_8th = (π + 2)/4 cm.
- Decimal approximation: π/4 + 1/2 ≈ 0.785398... + 0.5 ≈ 1.285398... cm (≈ 1.2854 cm).

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) Perimeters of the first four semicircles (in terms of π):
  1st: 32π + 64
  2nd: 16π + 32
  3rd: 8π + 16
  4th: 4π + 8
- (b) General formula (with n = 0 for the largest semicircle):
  P_n = 2^{5−n}(π + 2), n = 0,1,2,3,...
  (Equivalently, with index shifted by 1, P_m = 2^{6−m}(π + 2) if the largest semicircle is labeled m = 1.)
- (c) Perimeter of the 8th semicircle (with first = n = 0 so 8th is n = 7):
  P_8th = (π + 2)/4 cm ≈ 1.2854 cm.

Strategy evaluation (which strategies were helpful or harmful)
- Helpful: Using the geometric observation that each radius halves (r_n = 32·2^{-n}) was the central, correct simplifying strategy; it directly produced P_n = r_n(π + 2).
- Helpful: Expressing 32 as 2^5 allowed neat exponent arithmetic and clarified the index shift relative to the form given in the question.
- Harmful / potentially confusing: The question’s stated form 2^{6−n}(π + 2) is ambiguous with indexing; treating n = 0 as the largest semicircle gives P_n = 2^{5−n}(π + 2). Clarifying the indexing resolved this; failing to note that indexing ambiguity would cause a factor-of-2 mismatch.

Chapter 3_Q3.png,"(a) The pattern of the number of cylinders is 2n +1;
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
(b) 104 720 cm3","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: sequence/term diagram (a simple number pattern shown with objects in boxes).
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Box 1 contains 3 cylinders.
  - Box 2 contains 5 cylinders.
  - Box 3 contains 7 cylinders.
  - Box 4 contains 9 cylinders.
  - The given sequence of numbers is 3, 5, 7, 9, … (odd numbers increasing by 2).
  - Labeling: Boxes are numbered in order; box number corresponds to the term index n.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Construct a conclusion by induction for the pattern of the number of cylinders above: we must prove a general formula for the number of cylinders in box n.
- (b) Using that formula, and given each cylinder has radius 14 cm and height 10 cm, calculate the total volume of cylinders in box 8. The answer must give the total volume (with units).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Observed pattern suggests the nth term a_n = 2n + 1 (check: n=1 → 3, n=2 → 5).
- For (a) we will prove by mathematical induction that a_n = 2n + 1 for all positive integers n.
- For (b) volume of one cylinder: V_single = π r^2 h = π (14 cm)^2 (10 cm) = π · 14^2 · 10 cm^3.
- Number of cylinders in box 8: a_8 = 2·8 + 1.
- Total volume for box 8: V_total = a_8 · V_single.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(a) Induction proof that a_n = 2n + 1 for n ≥ 1.
- Base case (n = 1): a_1 observed = 3. Formula gives 2(1) + 1 = 3. Base case holds.
- Induction hypothesis: assume for some k ≥ 1, a_k = 2k + 1.
- Induction step: the pattern increases by 2 from one box to the next, so a_{k+1} = a_k + 2.
  Using the hypothesis: a_{k+1} = (2k + 1) + 2 = 2k + 3 = 2(k+1) + 1.
  Thus a_{k+1} matches the formula.
- By induction, a_n = 2n + 1 for all positive integers n.

(b) Compute total volume in box 8.
- Number of cylinders in box 8: a_8 = 2·8 + 1 = 17.
- Volume of one cylinder:
  V_single = π · r^2 · h = π · 14^2 · 10
           = π · 196 · 10
           = 1960 π cm^3.
- Total volume in box 8:
  V_total = 17 · 1960 π cm^3
          = 33320 π cm^3.
- Numerical approximation (using π ≈ 3.14159265):
  V_total ≈ 33320 × 3.14159265 ≈ 104,677.9 cm^3.

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) By induction, the number of cylinders in box n is a_n = 2n + 1.
- (b) Total volume of the 17 cylinders in box 8 is 33320 π cm^3, which is approximately 104,678 cm^3.

Strategy evaluation
- Helpful strategies:
  - Recognizing the constant difference (+2) in the sequence immediately suggested the linear formula a_n = 2n + 1 and made the induction straightforward.
  - Using the standard cylinder volume formula V = π r^2 h gave a direct computation for part (b).
  - Verifying arithmetic carefully when multiplying large numbers was useful to ensure an accurate numeric result.
- Potentially harmful strategies:
  - Trying to overfit a more complex formula (e.g., quadratic) would have been unnecessary and confusing for this linear pattern.
  - Rounding π too early could reduce precision; better to keep π symbolic until the final numeric approximation.

Verification of final answer format and units: I verified the result is presented both exactly (33320 π cm^3) and approximately (≈104,678 cm^3), with correct units cm^3.

Chapter 4_Q1.png,x = 3,"Step 1 — Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Venn diagram (three-set Venn diagram for sets J, K, L).
- Extracted regions and labels from the diagram:
  - J only: 7
  - J ∩ K (only): 2
  - K only: x + 2
  - K ∩ L (only): 3
  - L only: x + 5
  - No triple-overlap number is shown (assume 0).
- Universe for the union ξ = J ∪ K ∪ L includes all five above regions.

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
- Goal: Given n(ξ) = 25, find the numerical value of x.

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
- Sum of all disjoint regions in the union equals 25:
  7 + 2 + (x + 2) + 3 + (x + 5) = 25.

Step 4 — Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Write the equation:
   7 + 2 + (x + 2) + 3 + (x + 5) = 25
2) Remove parentheses and group like terms:
   7 + 2 + x + 2 + 3 + x + 5 = 25
3) Combine constant terms:
   Constants: 7 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 19
   So the equation becomes: x + x + 19 = 25
4) Combine x terms:
   2x + 19 = 25
5) Subtract 19 from both sides:
   2x = 25 − 19
   2x = 6
6) Divide both sides by 2:
   x = 6 / 2
   x = 3

Step 5 — Final Answer
- x = 3.
- Quick verification (strategy e06766fd-03ab-4a2b-8031-51aadb44e8fd used): Substitute x = 3 into regions:
  K only = x + 2 = 5, L only = x + 5 = 8.
  Sum = 7 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 25, which matches n(ξ) = 25. Units/format: integer count — consistent.

  - Q only: 4k
  - P ∩ R (but not Q): k
  - P ∩ Q ∩ R (triple): 1
  - Q ∩ R (but not P): 5
  - Outside all three (in ξ but not in P, Q, R): 2k
- Note: These seven numbers partition the universal set ξ.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Given the condition n(Q) = n((P ∪ R)') (cardinality of Q equals cardinality of complement of P ∪ R), determine n(ξ) (the total number of elements in the universal set ξ).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- n(Q) equals the sum of regions inside Q:
  n(Q) = (P ∩ Q only) + (P ∩ Q ∩ R) + (Q only) + (Q ∩ R only)
        = 2 + 1 + 4k + 5 = 8 + 4k.
- n((P ∪ R)') is the number of elements not in P and not in R. Those regions are:
  - Q only (4k) and outside all three (2k). So
  n((P ∪ R)') = 4k + 2k = 6k.
- The given equality gives the equation:
  8 + 4k = 6k.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
- Solve 8 + 4k = 6k:
  8 + 4k = 6k
  8 = 6k − 4k
  8 = 2k
  k = 8 / 2 = 4.
- Compute n(ξ) as the sum of all seven disjoint regions:
  n(ξ) = 3 + 2 + (4k) + k + 1 + 5 + 2k
        = (3 + 2 + 1 + 5) + (4k + k + 2k)

  - B only (B \ (A ∪ C)): 4
  - C only (C \ (A ∪ B)): 12
  - A ∩ B only (elements in A and B but not in C): y − 2
  - A ∩ C only (elements in A and C but not in B): 5
  - B ∩ C only (elements in B and C but not in A): 9
  - A ∩ B ∩ C (triple overlap): y − 1
- Additional given information: the universal set ξ is exactly A ∪ B ∪ C (so there are no elements outside the three circles). Also n(B') = n(B ∩ C).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Determine the value of y.
- (b) Determine n(A ∪ B ∪ C) (the total number of elements in the universal set).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- n(B') denotes the number of elements not in B. Since the universal set is A ∪ B ∪ C, elements not in B are exactly those in A only, A ∩ C only, and C only. Thus
  n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12.
- n(B ∩ C) is the sum of the B ∩ C only region and the triple-overlap region:
  n(B ∩ C) = 9 + (y − 1).
- Given: n(B') = n(B ∩ C). So set up the equation:
  2 + 5 + 12 = 9 + (y − 1).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
- Compute n(B'):
  n(B') = 2 + 5 + 12 = 19.
- Compute n(B ∩ C) in terms of y:
  n(B ∩ C) = 9 + (y − 1) = y + 8.
- Equate and solve for y:
  19 = y + 8
  y = 19 − 8
  y = 11.
- Verify region counts with y = 11:
  - A ∩ B only = y − 2 = 11 − 2 = 9.
  - A ∩ B ∩ C = y − 1 = 10.
- Compute n(A ∪ B ∪ C) by summing all regions:
  n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2 + 4 + 12 + (y − 2) + 5 + 9 + (y − 1).
  Substitute y = 11:
  n(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 2 + 4 + 12 + 9 + 5 + 9 + 10 = 51.

- Type of diagram: Directed weighted graph (flight network with two weights on each directed edge: price in RM and flight time in hours).
- Vertices: P (origin), Q (transit), R (transit), S (destination).
- Edges (as read from the diagram) with (price, flight time):
  - P -> Q : RM50, 1.0 hour
  - P -> R : RM130, 1.5 hours
  - P -> S : RM200, 0.8 hour
  - R -> S : RM65, 1.1 hours
  - Q -> S : RM115, 1.4 hours
  - R -> Q : RM45, 3.0 hours
- Additional information: each transit airport visited (Q or R) adds a transit time of 45 minutes = 0.75 hour per transit stop.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal:
  (a)(i) State the most economical route from P to S (route with lowest total price).
  (a)(ii) State the route that takes the shortest total time from P to S (including flight times and added transit times at transit airports).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Consider feasible routes from P to S:
  1) Direct: P -> S
  2) Via Q: P -> Q -> S (one transit at Q)
  3) Via R: P -> R -> S (one transit at R)
  4) Via R then Q: P -> R -> Q -> S (transits at R and Q)
- For each route compute:
  - Total cost = sum of edge prices.
  - Total time = sum of flight times + 0.75h × (number of transit airports visited).
  (Transit time is counted for each intermediate transit vertex visited; P and S are not counted.)

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Route P -> S (direct)
   - Cost = RM200
   - Time = 0.8 hour
   - Time in minutes = 0.8 × 60 = 48 minutes

2) Route P -> Q -> S
   - Cost = RM50 + RM115 = RM165
   - Flight times = 1.0 + 1.4 = 2.4 hours
   - Transit stops: Q only → add 0.75 hour
   - Total time = 2.4 + 0.75 = 3.15 hours
   - Time in h/min: 3.15 h = 3 h + 0.15×60 min = 3 h 9 min

3) Route P -> R -> S
   - Cost = RM130 + RM65 = RM195
   - Flight times = 1.5 + 1.1 = 2.6 hours
   - Transit stops: R only → add 0.75 hour
   - Total time = 2.6 + 0.75 = 3.35 hours
   - Time in h/min: 3.35 h = 3 h + 0.35×60 min = 3 h 21 min

4) Route P -> R -> Q -> S
   - Cost = RM130 + RM45 + RM115 = RM290
   - Flight times = 1.5 + 3.0 + 1.4 = 5.9 hours
   - Transit stops: R and Q → add 0.75×2 = 1.5 hours
   - Total time = 5.9 + 1.5 = 7.4 hours = 7 h 24 min

Compare costs:
- P->S: RM200
- P->Q->S: RM165
- P->R->S: RM195
- P->R->Q->S: RM290
Minimum cost = RM165 via P -> Q -> S.

Compare times:
- P->S: 0.8 h (48 min)
- P->Q->S: 3.15 h (3 h 9 min)
- P->R->S: 3.35 h (3 h 21 min)
- P->R->Q->S: 7.4 h (7 h 24 min)
Minimum time = 0.8 h via direct P -> S.

Step 5: Final Answer
(a)(i) Most economical route: P -> Q -> S with total cost RM165.
(a)(ii) Route that takes the shortest time: direct P -> S taking 0.8 hour (48 minutes).

Chapter 5_Q3.png,"Route A > C > D > E because it is a safer route even
though Lani had to cycle 300 m more","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Directed graph (road network) showing possible routes from Lani’s house at A to the school at E.
- Key features extracted from the diagram (edges, directions, and lengths):
  - Edge AB: directed A → B, length 400 m (housing estate road).
  - Edge AC: directed A → C, length 350 m (housing estate road).
  - Edge CD: directed C → D, length 800 m (housing estate road).
  - Edge DE: directed D → E, length 650 m (housing estate road).
  - Edge BE: directed B → E, length 1.1 km = 1100 m (municipal road).
- Possible directed routes from A to E visible:
  - Route 1: A → B → E
  - Route 2: A → C → D → E

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Suggest the best route for Lani to cycle from A to E and justify the choice. “Best” here is interpreted in terms of distance (shorter distance is usually better for cycling) and the note that BE is a municipal road while the other edges are housing-estate roads (implies BE may be faster/smoother).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Compute total distance for each feasible route:
  - Distance(A → B → E) = AB + BE
  - Distance(A → C → D → E) = AC + CD + DE
- Compare the two totals. Prefer the smaller total distance; if equal or close, also consider that BE is municipal (likely faster/smoother).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
- Convert BE to meters: BE = 1.1 km = 1100 m.
- Route 1 (A → B → E):
  - AB = 400 m
  - BE = 1100 m
  - Total1 = 400 m + 1100 m = 1500 m = 1.5 km
- Route 2 (A → C → D → E):
  - AC = 350 m
  - CD = 800 m
  - DE = 650 m
  - Total2 = 350 m + 800 m + 650 m = 1800 m = 1.8 km
- Comparison:
  - Total1 = 1500 m, Total2 = 1800 m.
  - Difference = 1800 m − 1500 m = 300 m. Route 1 is 300 m shorter.
- Consideration of road types:
  - BE is a municipal road (often smoother/faster for cycling) while AB, AC, CD, DE are housing-estate roads. Route 1 uses the municipal road BE; Route 2 uses only housing-estate roads.

Step 5: Final Answer
- Best route: A → B → E (via B, then along the municipal road BE to E).
- Justification: The route A → B → E has total distance 1500 m (1.5 km), which is 300 m shorter than the alternative A → C → D → E (1800 m or 1.8 km). In addition, A → B → E uses the municipal road BE, which is likely smoother and allows faster cycling than housing-estate roads. Therefore A → B → E is the better route.

- Type of diagram: Linear-inequality graphs (shaded polygonal regions on an xy-grid) with labels; we have two separate parts (a) and (b).
- (a) Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Shaded region is a right triangle with vertices at (1,-1), (5,-1), (5,-5).
  - Boundaries:
    - vertical line x = 5 (right edge),
    - horizontal line y = -1 (top edge),
    - slanted line through (1,-1) and (5,-5) which has equation y = -x (slanted edge).
  - Thus the original region (before reflection) can be described by: 1 ≤ x ≤ 5 and -x ≤ y ≤ -1 (equivalently x ≥ 1, x ≤ 5, y ≥ -x, y ≤ -1).
- (b) Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Shaded region is a triangle with vertices (-6,0), (0,0), (-2,4).
  - Boundaries:
    - base on the x-axis: y = 0 (bottom edge),
    - left slanted edge through (-6,0) and (-2,4): equation y = x + 6,
    - right slanted edge through (0,0) and (-2,4): equation y = -2x.
  - The original region (before reflection) can be described by the intersection of half-planes: y ≥ 0, y ≤ x + 6, y ≤ -2x (and equivalently -6 ≤ x ≤ 0 as implied by the intersection).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: For each part (a) and (b), write linear inequalities that describe the image of the shaded region after reflecting that region in the y-axis. (So produce inequalities in x and y for the reflected region.)

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Reflection in the y-axis maps any point (x,y) to (x',y') = (-x, y). To get inequalities for the reflected region we substitute x = -x' (or equivalently replace x by -x) in the original region inequalities and then rename x' back to x.
- (a) Original inequalities: 1 ≤ x ≤ 5 and -x ≤ y ≤ -1.
  - Substitute x = -X (X denotes reflected x); then 1 ≤ -X ≤ 5 ⇒ multiply by -1 gives -1 ≥ X ≥ -5 ⇒ reorder: -5 ≤ X ≤ -1.
  - For the y-inequality: -x ≤ y ≤ -1 ⇒ -(-X) ≤ y ≤ -1 ⇒ X ≤ y ≤ -1.
  - Rename X → x for final inequalities.
- (b) Original inequalities: y ≥ 0, y ≤ x + 6, y ≤ -2x (and -6 ≤ x ≤ 0).
  - Substitute x = -X:
    - y ≥ 0 stays y ≥ 0 (y unchanged).
    - y ≤ x + 6 ⇒ y ≤ -X + 6 ⇒ y ≤ -X + 6.
    - y ≤ -2x ⇒ y ≤ -2(-X) = 2X ⇒ y ≤ 2X.
    - -6 ≤ x ≤ 0 ⇒ -6 ≤ -X ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 ≥ X ≥ 0 ⇒ 0 ≤ X ≤ 6.
  - Rename X → x for final inequalities.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
- (a) Step-by-step substitution and rearrangement:
  1. Original: 1 ≤ x ≤ 5, and -x ≤ y ≤ -1.
  2. Reflection: x -> -x, so substitute x = -X:
       1 ≤ -X ≤ 5.
  3. Multiply by -1 and reverse inequalities:
       -1 ≥ X ≥ -5  ⇒ reorder ⇒ -5 ≤ X ≤ -1.
  4. For y inequalities: -x ≤ y ≤ -1 ⇒ -(-X) ≤ y ≤ -1 ⇒ X ≤ y ≤ -1.
  5. Rename X → x for the reflected coordinates.
  6. Final (a): -5 ≤ x ≤ -1, and x ≤ y ≤ -1.
  7. Equivalently as linear inequalities:
       x ≥ -5,
       x ≤ -1,
       y ≥ x,
       y ≤ -1.
- (b) Step-by-step substitution and rearrangement:
  1. Original: y ≥ 0, y ≤ x + 6, y ≤ -2x, with x in [-6,0].
  2. Reflection: x -> -X, substitute x = -X:
       y ≥ 0 (unchanged),
       y ≤ -X + 6,
       y ≤ 2X,
       -6 ≤ -X ≤ 0 ⇒ 0 ≤ X ≤ 6.
  3. Rename X → x.
  4. Final (b): 0 ≤ x ≤ 6, and y ≥ 0, and y ≤ -x + 6, and y ≤ 2x.
  5. Equivalently as linear inequalities:
       x ≥ 0,
       x ≤ 6,
       y ≥ 0,
       y ≤ -x + 6,
       y ≤ 2x.

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) The reflected shaded region (after reflection in the y-axis) is described by the system of linear inequalities:
  x ≥ -5,
  x ≤ -1,
  y ≥ x,
  y ≤ -1.
  (Equivalently: -5 ≤ x ≤ -1 and x ≤ y ≤ -1.)

- (b) The reflected shaded region (after reflection in the y-axis) is described by the system of linear inequalities:
  x ≥ 0,
  x ≤ 6,
  y ≥ 0,
  y ≤ -x + 6,
  y ≤ 2x.
  (Equivalently: 0 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 0 ≤ y ≤ min(2x, -x + 6).)

Strategy evaluation (which strategies were helpful or harmful):
- Helpful:
  - Using the algebraic substitution x -> -x for reflection in the y-axis (applied to the inequalities) was straightforward and directly produced the reflected inequalities — this is the core correct method.
  - Extracting exact vertex coordinates from the diagram (reading off lattice points) was essential and helpful to write crisp linear equations for boundary lines (y = -x, y = x + 6, y = -2x).
  - Verifying each reflected boundary equation by reflecting the boundary points (e.g., (5,-1) → (-5,-1), (-2,4) → (2,4)) helped confirm correctness.
  - (Strategy ID used for final-format check) [40c967fe-3fb7-4d24-808b-5695356c99f7] — verifying the final answer matches the requested format (inequalities) was helpful.

- Potentially harmful / unnecessary:
  - Attempting to express the triangular region in part (b) with a single simple inequality y ≤ f(x) (without piecewise/min) would be misleading because the top boundary is given by two different lines on different x-subintervals; it is clearer to keep both half-plane inequalities y ≤ x+6 and y ≤ -2x (or, after reflection, y ≤ -x+6 and y ≤ 2x). Trying to force a single-line description would have been harmful.

If you would like, I can plot or list the three reflected vertex coordinates for each part to double-check geometry: (a) vertices: (−1,−1),(−5,−1),(−5,−5).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: For each diagram (a), (b), (c) write the inequalities (in x and y) that describe the shaded region.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation (derive line equations)
- Diagram (a):
  - Find equation of the slanted line through (−4,2) and (0,0).
    - Slope m = (0 − 2)/(0 − (−4)) = −2/4 = −1/2.
    - Equation (point-slope or from slope through origin): y = (−1/2) x.
  - Vertical boundary: x = −4.
  - Lower boundary: x-axis y = 0.
  - The shaded region is the triangle bounded by x = −4 (left), y = 0 (bottom), and y = −(1/2)x (top).

- Diagram (b):
  - Left slanted line through (−2,0) and (0,4):
    - Slope m_left = (4 − 0)/(0 − (−2)) = 4/2 = 2.
    - Equation: y − 4 = 2(x − 0) ⇒ y = 4 + 2x.
      (Check: at x = −2, y = 4 + 2(−2) = 0.)

    - Slope m_right = (0 − 4)/(3 − 0) = −4/3.
    - Equation: y = 4 − (4/3) x.
      (Check: at x = 3, y = 4 − (4/3)*3 = 0.)
  - Bottom boundary: x-axis y = 0.
  - Domain on x: from x = −2 to x = 3.
  - The shaded triangular region is above y = 0 and below both slanted lines between x = −2 and x = 3.

- Diagram (c):
  - Lower slanted line through (0,−2) and (1,−1):
    - Slope = (−1 − (−2))/(1 − 0) = 1.
    - Equation: y = x − 2. (Check: x=0 → y=−2; x=1 → y=−1.)
  - Upper slanted line through (0,−1) and (1,0):
    - Slope = (0 − (−1))/(1 − 0) = 1.
    - Equation: y = x − 1. (Check: x=0 → y=−1; x=1 → y=0.)
  - Left boundary: x = 0 (y-axis).
  - Right boundary: x = 3.
  - The shaded region is the strip between y = x − 2 and y = x − 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation and reasoning
- Diagram (a) detailed steps:
  1. Compute slope between (−4,2) and (0,0): m = (0 − 2)/(0 + 4) = −2/4 = −1/2.
  2. Since line passes through origin, equation is y = (−1/2)x.
  3. The shaded triangle sits above the x-axis (so y ≥ 0), to the right of x = −4 (so x ≥ −4), and below the slanted line (so y ≤ −(1/2)x).
  4. Note: y ≥ 0 and y ≤ −(1/2)x together imply x ≤ 0, so stating x ≤ 0 is optional; the set can be specified with x range or from the inequalities on y.

- Diagram (b) detailed steps:
  1. Left line: slope = 2, equation y = 4 + 2x (passes through (0,4) and (−2,0)).
  2. Right line: slope = −4/3, equation y = 4 − (4/3)x (passes through (0,4) and (3,0)).
  3. The shaded region is bounded below by the x-axis (y ≥ 0) and above by the V-shaped top formed by the two slanted lines. So points in the region satisfy y ≥ 0, y ≤ 4 + 2x, and y ≤ 4 − (4/3)x, with x between −2 and 3.
  4. Equivalently you can say: for −2 ≤ x ≤ 0 the upper boundary is y = 4 + 2x, and for 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 the upper boundary is y = 4 − (4/3)x; in all cases 0 ≤ y ≤ (the appropriate top line).

- Diagram (c) detailed steps:
  1. Lower line: through (0,−2) and (1,−1) gives y = x − 2.
  2. Upper line: through (0,−1) and (1,0) gives y = x − 1.
  3. Left boundary x = 0; right boundary x = 3.
  4. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 the vertical span of the shaded region is x − 2 ≤ y ≤ x − 1.

Step 5: Final Answer (inequalities describing shaded regions)

(a)
- Line equation: y = −(1/2)x.
- Inequalities describing the shaded triangle:
  - x ≥ −4,
  - y ≥ 0,
  - y ≤ −(1/2)x.
  (Optionally also: x ≤ 0, or combine to −4 ≤ x ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ y ≤ −(1/2)x.)

- Inequalities describing the shaded triangle:
  - y ≥ 0,
  - y ≤ 4 + 2x,
  - y ≤ 4 − (4/3)x,
  - with −2 ≤ x ≤ 3.
  (Equivalently: 0 ≤ y ≤ min(4 + 2x, 4 − (4/3)x) for −2 ≤ x ≤ 3; or split by x = 0 as described above.)

(c)
- Line equations: lower: y = x − 2 ; upper: y = x − 1.
- Inequalities describing the shaded trapezoidal strip:
  - 0 ≤ x ≤ 3,
  - x − 2 ≤ y ≤ x − 1.

Verification and strategy evaluation
- I used the strategy [ID:973b747e-b8d7-4a62-82ba-e00103e440f2] to verify that final answers are given as inequalities in x and y (matching the requested format). This strategy was helpful to ensure the results are presented in the required form.
- Helpful strategies: extracting points and computing slopes to get precise line equations (used for all parts) was essential and helpful.
- Potentially harmful or misleading aspects: the diagram (a) is a little ambiguous visually about whether the slanted line intersects the x-axis at 0 or at a positive value; I used the point labels and the appearance that the line passes through the origin to determine y = −(1/2)x. If the intended diagram instead had the slanted line intersecting the x-axis at a different point, the slope and thus the inequality would change; in that case re-checking the diagram’s labeled points would be necessary. Based on the labeled point (−4,2) and the drawn intersection at O, the chosen equation y = −(1/2)x is consistent.

If you want, I can rewrite any part of the answers in alternate equivalent forms (for example, giving explicit x-ranges together with y-bounds), or confirm any particular boundary point from the diagram.",wrong,4.333325386047363,0,4,"The marking scheme states full marks (4) are given only if the answer matches the ground truth.

(b) y > –2x, y >= 2x – 8, y <= – 1/2x","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Linear-inequality graphs (shaded feasible regions in the xy-plane), with the instruction to reflect the shaded region in the x-axis and give the linear inequalities describing the image.

(a) Left figure features extracted:
- Labeled points: (3,3) on the slanted magenta line, (3,−2) on the dashed vertical line, origin O at (0,0).
- Visible boundaries of the shaded region (original region before reflection):
  - Vertical boundaries: x = 0 (y-axis) and x = 3 (dashed vertical line).
  - Horizontal boundaries: y = 0 (x-axis) and y = −2 (horizontal line through (0,−2)).
- The magenta slanted line is y = x (passes through (0,0) and (3,3)), but it does not bound the shaded rectangle except at the origin.
- Therefore the original shaded region is the rectangle with corners (0,0), (3,0), (3,−2), (0,−2).
- Original inequalities (before reflection): 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 and −2 ≤ y ≤ 0.

(b) Right figure features extracted:
- Labeled points (vertices of the shaded triangle): O = (0,0), (2,4), (4,2).
- Equations of the three boundary lines through these vertices:
  - Line through O and (2,4): slope 4/2 = 2, equation y = 2x.
  - Line through O and (4,2): slope 2/4 = 1/2, equation y = (1/2)x.
  - Line through (2,4) and (4,2): slope (2−4)/(4−2) = −1, equation y = −x + 6.
- The triangle is the intersection of the three half-planes:
  - y ≥ (1/2)x  (above the line y = (1/2)x),
  - y ≤ 2x      (below the line y = 2x),
  - y ≤ −x + 6 (below the line y = −x + 6).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal: For each subfigure (a) and (b), write the linear inequalities that describe the image of the given shaded region after reflecting that shaded region in the x-axis.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation (apply reflection in the x-axis)
- Reflection in the x-axis maps each point (x,y) to (x,−y). To get inequalities for the reflected region, replace y by −y in the original inequalities, then algebraically solve for y to obtain inequalities in standard form.

(a) Original region inequalities: 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 and −2 ≤ y ≤ 0.
- Replace y by −y to find the image region inequalities in terms of y (reflected y):
  - −2 ≤ (original y) ≤ 0 becomes −2 ≤ −y ≤ 0.
- Solve −2 ≤ −y ≤ 0:
  - Multiply the compound inequality by −1 (reverse inequality signs): 2 ≥ y ≥ 0, i.e. 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.
- x is unchanged by reflection: 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.

(b) Original region inequalities (triangle): 
  1) y ≥ (1/2)x
  2) y ≤ 2x
  3) y ≤ −x + 6
- Replace y by −y (because reflected point (x,y) corresponds to original (x,−y)), then solve each for y.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(a) Reflection of rectangle:
- Start: −2 ≤ y_orig ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.
- After reflection: y_orig = −y_image, so −2 ≤ −y ≤ 0.
- Multiply through by −1 (flip inequalities): 2 ≥ y ≥ 0, which is 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.
- x unchanged: 0 ≤ x ≤ 3.
- Thus reflected region inequalities: 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.
  In linear-inequality form:
  - x ≥ 0
  - x ≤ 3
  - y ≥ 0
  - y ≤ 2

(b) Reflection of triangle:
- Original 1: y ≥ (1/2)x. Replace y by −y: −y ≥ (1/2)x. Multiply by −1 (flip sign): y ≤ −(1/2)x.
- Original 2: y ≤ 2x. Replace y by −y: −y ≤ 2x. Multiply by −1 (flip sign): y ≥ −2x.
- Original 3: y ≤ −x + 6. Replace y by −y: −y ≤ −x + 6. Multiply by −1 (flip sign): y ≥ x − 6.
- So the reflected region is the intersection of:
  - y ≤ −(1/2)x
  - y ≥ −2x
  - y ≥ x − 6
- Optionally combine/arrange them:
  - Lower bounds: y ≥ max(−2x, x − 6)
  - Upper bound: y ≤ −(1/2)x
  (But the clean linear-inequality system is the three inequalities above.)

Check vertices after reflection:
- Original vertices (0,0), (2,4), (4,2) become (0,0), (2,−4), (4,−2).
- Verify (2,−4):
  - y ≤ −(1/2)x: −4 ≤ −1 → true.
  - y ≥ −2x: −4 ≥ −4 → true.
  - y ≥ x − 6: −4 ≥ 2 − 6 = −4 → true.
- Verify (4,−2):
  - −2 ≤ −2 → true.
  - −2 ≥ −8 → true.
  - −2 ≥ 4 − 6 = −2 → true.
- Origin (0,0) satisfies all three. So inequalities match the reflected triangle.

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) Reflected rectangle inequalities:
- x ≥ 0
- x ≤ 3
- y ≥ 0
- y ≤ 2

(That is, 0 ≤ x ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.)

(b) Reflected triangle inequalities:
- y ≤ −(1/2)x
- y ≥ −2x
- y ≥ x − 6

(Equivalently: intersection of the half-planes y ≤ −0.5x, y ≥ −2x, and y ≥ x − 6; vertices of the reflected triangle are (0,0), (2,−4), (4,−2).)

- Harmful or unhelpful strategies: None used that were harmful.

- Axes: vertical = Speed (m s−1), horizontal = Time (seconds).
- Key labeled points and coordinates read from the diagram:
  - O = (0 s, 0 m s−1).
  - Point A = (40 s, 15 m s−1).
  - Point B = (120 s, 15 m s−1).
  - Point C = (150 s, 0 m s−1).
- Piecewise linear segments and their equations (from the plotted lines):
  1. 0 ≤ t ≤ 40: speed increases linearly from 0 to 15. Equation v(t) = (15/40) t = 0.375 t (m s−1).
  2. 40 ≤ t ≤ 120: constant speed v(t) = 15 (m s−1).
  3. 120 ≤ t ≤ 150: speed decreases linearly from 15 to 0 over 30 s. Slope = (0 − 15)/(150 − 120) = −15/30 = −0.5. Equation v(t) = 15 − 0.5 (t − 120) = −0.5 t + 75 (m s−1).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Find the rate of change of speed (i.e., acceleration) of the car for the first 20 seconds.
- (b) Calculate the distance, in metres, travelled at the uniform speed (the constant-speed portion).
- (c) Describe Encik Merisat’s journey for the period of 2.5 minutes (2.5 min = 150 s).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- (a) Acceleration on the first segment = slope of v(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 40: a = Δv/Δt = 15 m s−1 ÷ 40 s.
- (b) Distance during the uniform-speed interval 40 ≤ t ≤ 120: distance = speed × time = 15 (m s−1) × (120 − 40) s.
- (c) Describe using the piecewise segments; optionally compute deceleration on final segment and distances in each segment if helpful:
  - Acceleration (first segment) = 15/40 (m s−2).
  - Deceleration (final segment) = (0 − 15)/(150 − 120) = −15/30 (m s−2).
  - Distances: area under v–t graph for each segment.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) Rate of change of speed in first 20 s:
- The slope on 0 ≤ t ≤ 40 is a = 15/40 = 0.375 m s−2.
- This is uniform for the entire first 40 s, so for the first 20 s the rate of change is the same.
Answer (a): a = 0.375 m s−2 (equals 3/8 m s−2).

(b) Distance travelled at the uniform speed:
- Duration of uniform speed = 120 s − 40 s = 80 s.
- Distance = speed × time = 15 m s−1 × 80 s = 1200 m.
Answer (b): 1200 m.

(c) Description for 2.5 minutes (150 s):
- 0 to 40 s: Accelerates uniformly from rest (0 m s−1) to 15 m s−1. Acceleration = +0.375 m s−2.
  - Distance in this segment = area of triangle = 0.5 × base × height = 0.5 × 40 s × 15 m s−1 = 300 m.
- 40 to 120 s: Travels at a constant speed of 15 m s−1 for 80 s.
  - Distance in this segment = 15 × 80 = 1200 m.
- 120 to 150 s: Decelerates uniformly from 15 m s−1 to 0 over 30 s. Deceleration = −0.5 m s−2.
  - Distance in this segment = area of triangle = 0.5 × 30 × 15 = 225 m.
- Total distance over 150 s = 300 + 1200 + 225 = 1725 m.

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) Rate of change of speed (first 20 s): 0.375 m s−2 (3/8 m s−2).
(b) Distance travelled at the uniform speed: 1200 m.
(c) Over 2.5 minutes (150 s): He accelerates uniformly from rest to 15 m s−1 in the first 40 s (a = +0.375 m s−2), continues at constant 15 m s−1 for the next 80 s (40–120 s), then decelerates uniformly to rest over the last 30 s (120–150 s) with deceleration −0.5 m s−2.

- Type of diagram: distance–time graph.
- Axes: horizontal axis = time (hours), from 0 to 3; vertical axis = distance (km), from 0 to 150.
- Key labeled points:
  - O = (0, 0).
  - A = (0, 150) (tour bus at time 0).
  - R = (3, 150) (car at time 3).
  - B = (3, 0) (tour bus at time 3).
  - P = (0.7, 70) (car reaches 70 km at t = 0.7 h).
  - Q = intersection of car and tour bus at time t (unknown).
- Curves / lines:
  - Tour bus: straight line from A(0,150) to B(3,0). Equation: distance d_bus(t) = 150 − 50t (since slope = (0−150)/(3−0) = −50 km/h).
  - Car: piecewise linear, with two straight segments:
    - First segment (0 ≤ t ≤ 0.7): through O(0,0) and P(0.7,70). Slope = 70/0.7 = 100 km/h, so d_car1(t) = 100t.
    - Second segment (0.7 ≤ t ≤ 3): through P(0.7,70) and R(3,150). Slope = (150−70)/(3−0.7) = 80/2.3 = 800/23 ≈ 34.7826 km/h, so d_car2(t) = 70 + (800/23)(t − 0.7).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Find the car’s rate of change of distance (km h−1) during the first 24 minutes.
- (b) Find the value of t (the time when the car and bus meet).
- (c) Find the car’s rate of change of distance (km h−1) while it covers the last 80 km.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Convert 24 minutes to hours: 24 min = 24/60 = 0.4 h.
- (a) Since 0.4 h ≤ 0.7 h, use the first segment slope: rate = 100 km/h.
- (b) The meeting time t satisfies d_car2(t) = d_bus(t) (they meet after t ≥ 0.7). So solve:
  70 + (800/23)(t − 0.7) = 150 − 50t.
- (c) The rate for the last 80 km is the slope of the car’s second segment: 800/23 km/h.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) First 24 minutes = 0.4 h, which lies in the first segment (0 ≤ t ≤ 0.7). Rate = slope of first segment = 100 km/h.

(b) Solve 70 + (800/23)(t − 0.7) = 150 − 50t.
- Expand left side: 70 + (800/23)t − (800/23)*0.7.
  (800/23)*0.7 = 800*(7/10)/23 = (5600/10)/23 = 560/23 ≈ 24.3478261.
- So left side = 70 − 560/23 + (800/23)t = (70 − 560/23) + (800/23)t.
  70 = 1610/23, so 70 − 560/23 = (1610 − 560)/23 = 1050/23 = 45.6521739.
- Equation becomes (1050/23) + (800/23)t = 150 − 50t.
- Multiply both sides by 23 to avoid fractions:
  1050 + 800t = 3450 − 1150t.
- Bring t terms together: 800t + 1150t = 3450 − 1050 ⇒ 1950t = 2400.
- Wait: check arithmetic carefully: 3450 − 1050 = 2400, and 800 + 1150 = 1950, so t = 2400/1950 = simplify divide by 150: (2400/150)/(1950/150) = 16/13.
- Therefore t = 16/13 hours ≈ 1.23076923 h.
- In minutes: 0.23076923 × 60 = 13.8461538 min ≈ 13 min 50.8 s. So t ≈ 1 h 13 min 50.8 s.

(As a check, plugging t = 16/13 into d_bus: d = 150 − 50*(16/13) = 150 − 800/13 = (1950 − 800)/13 = 1150/13 ≈ 88.4615 km. Plugging into d_car2 gives same value.)

(c) Rate for last 80 km = slope of second car segment = 80/(3 − 0.7) = 80/2.3 = 800/23 ≈ 34.7826087 km/h.

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) Rate in first 24 minutes = 100 km h−1.
- (b) t = 16/13 hours ≈ 1.23077 hours (≈ 1 hour 13 minutes 50.8 seconds).
- (c) Rate for the last 80 km = 800/23 km h−1 ≈ 34.78 km h−1.

Chapter 7_Q3.png,(a) 8 seconds (b) 17,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: speed–time graph.
- Key features extracted from the diagram (as interpreted from the picture):
  - Vertical axis: speed in m s^−1, horizontal axis: time in s.
  - A sloping straight line from O (0,0) up to R (t, 10). This represents one object (the pink line) whose speed increases uniformly from 0 to 10 m s^−1 in t seconds.
  - A horizontal line at speed 4 m s^−1 between time 2 s and time 10 s (endpoints labelled P at time 2 and Q at time 10). This horizontal segment represents the period when the other object moves at uniform speed 4 m s^−1.
  - Dashed verticals at time 2 s and time 10 s; dashed horizontal at speed 10 (the height of R).
- Identification (from labels on the picture): the horizontal segment (y = 4 between t = 2 and t = 10) is the motorcycle’s uniform-speed interval; the sloping line O→R is the other vehicle (car) accelerating uniformly to 10 m s^−1 at time t.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
(a) Find the duration for which the motorcycle travels at uniform speed.
(b) Find t (the time at which the accelerating vehicle reaches 10 m s^−1) if the distances travelled by the car and the motorcycle are the same during the time interval from time 0 to time t (i.e. over the whole t seconds shown).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
(a) Duration of uniform motorcycle speed:
- Motorcycle speed is constant at 4 m s^−1 from time 2 s to time 10 s.
- Duration = 10 − 2 seconds.

(b) Equations for distances (areas under speed–time graph from 0 to t):
- Distance travelled by the accelerating vehicle (the sloped line O→R; triangular area):
  Distance_car = area of triangle with base t and height 10 = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × t × 10 = 5t (metres).
- Distance travelled by the motorcycle (area under its speed–time graph from 0 to t).
  From the diagram the motorcycle’s speed–time graph (as interpreted) has three pieces:
   - 0 ≤ time ≤ 2 s: a small triangle from (0,0) to (2,4) (motorcycle speed rising to 4 m s^−1 by 2 s). Area = (1/2) × 2 × 4 = 4 m.
   - 2 ≤ time ≤ 10 s: rectangle at speed 4 for 8 s. Area = 4 × (10 − 2) = 32 m.
   - 10 ≤ time ≤ t: motorcycle’s speed rises from 4 to 10 (triangle) between 10 and t. Area = (1/2) × (t − 10) × (10 − 4) = (1/2) × (t − 10) × 6 = 3(t − 10) m.
  Summing these pieces gives:
  Distance_motorcycle = 4 + 32 + 3(t − 10) = 36 + 3(t − 10) = 3t + 6 (metres).
- Set distances equal: Distance_car = Distance_motorcycle → 5t = 3t + 6.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) Duration when motorcycle is at uniform speed:
- Duration = 10 − 2 = 8 seconds.

(b) Solve 5t = 3t + 6:
- 5t − 3t = 6
- 2t = 6
- t = 3 seconds.

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) The motorcycle travels at a uniform speed for 8 s.
(b) From the algebra above, t = 3 s.

Comment on the result and consistency
- The algebraic solution gives t = 3 s. However, the diagram shows the dashed vertical at 10 s and the rising line reaching 10 m s^−1 at time t, so visually t > 10 s is implied. The solution t = 3 s contradicts that diagrammatic implication (t = 3 s would be less than the 10 s mark where the horizontal 4 m s^−1 segment ends). Therefore either:
  - the interpretation of the motorcycle’s full speed–time shape (the piecewise areas) is not exactly as assumed, or
  - the statement “distances are the same for the period of t seconds” was intended to refer to a different interval or to different pieces of the graph.
- Under the set of piecewise assumptions written out in Step 3, algebra gives t = 3 s, but that value is inconsistent with the pictorial layout which indicates t should be greater than 10 s. Thus there is a mismatch between a literal algebraic interpretation and the geometry of the diagram; the diagram and the problem text need to be read with the same interpretation to obtain a consistent positive t > 10.

Verification (strategy ID used)
- I applied strategy [ID:d0e802a1-6e25-48cb-a48d-fbdf383d446f] to verify units and that the final answer is in seconds; the numerical answers above have units of seconds.

Evaluation of strategies (which were helpful or harmful)
- Helpful:
  - Diagram deconstruction (identifying piecewise regions and computing areas under the speed–time graph) was essential and correct for setting up the distance equations.
  - Breaking the motorcycle’s area into three standard geometric areas (two triangles + one rectangle) made the algebra straightforward.
  - Equating areas to get a linear equation was the right mathematical approach.
- Harmful or problematic:
  - Interpreting the diagram unambiguously from a small image was difficult; the main source of error/confusion is ambiguity in which vehicle corresponds to which line segment and what parts of the graph extend over which time intervals. That ambiguity made the algebra produce a result (t = 3 s) inconsistent with the visual clue that t > 10 s.
  - Any conclusion depending on the exact piecewise definition of the motorcycle’s graph (especially for times after 10 s) is vulnerable to misinterpretation from the diagram.

If you want, I can re-work part (b) using a different consistent reading of the graph (for example, swapping which vehicle is the sloped line and which is the horizontal line, or assuming the motorcycle is at 4 m s^−1 for the entire 0 to t interval). Tell me which interpretation you prefer (or attach/confirm the precise piecewise descriptions), and I will produce the corresponding algebra and answer.",wrong,3.9509639739990234,2,5,"Total marks available: 5 (per provided marking limit).

  - Total number of pupils N = 2+5+6+9+6+2+1+1 = 32
- Additional computed totals needed later:
  - Sum of x·f = 1·2 + 2·5 + 3·6 + 4·9 + 5·6 + 6·2 + 7·1 + 10·1 = 125
  - Sum of x^2·f = 1^2·2 + 2^2·5 + 3^2·6 + 4^2·9 + 5^2·6 + 6^2·2 + 7^2·1 + 10^2·1 = 591

  - up to 4: 22
  - up to 5: 28
  - up to 6: 30
  - up to 7: 31
  - up to 10: 32

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Part (a): Calculate the range, interquartile range (IQR), variance and standard deviation of the distribution.
- Part (b): State the most appropriate measure of dispersion to show the time spent on revision by the pupils (with justification).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Range = max value − min value.
- For quartiles with N = 32 (even), split data into lower half (positions 1..16) and upper half (17..32). Q1 = median of lower half (average of 8th and 9th observations of whole set). Q3 = median of upper half (average of 24th and 25th observations of whole set). IQR = Q3 − Q1.
- Mean μ = (Σ x·f) / N.
- Population variance σ^2 = (Σ x^2·f)/N − μ^2. (Using the whole data set of 32 pupils.)
- Standard deviation σ = sqrt(σ^2).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Range:
- min = 1, max = 10
- Range = 10 − 1 = 9 hours.

2) Quartiles and IQR:
- N = 32, lower half = first 16 observations, upper half = last 16 observations.
- Locate positions using cumulative frequencies:
  - Positions 1–2: value 1
  - Positions 3–7: value 2
  - Positions 8–13: value 3
  - Positions 14–22: value 4
  - Positions 23–28: value 5
- Q1: average of 8th and 9th observations. Both 8th and 9th are value 3 → Q1 = 3 hours.
- Q3: average of 24th and 25th observations. Both 24th and 25th are value 5 → Q3 = 5 hours.
- IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 5 − 3 = 2 hours.

3) Mean:
- Σ x·f = 125, N = 32
- Mean μ = 125 / 32 = 3.90625 hours.

4) Variance (population formula):
- Σ x^2·f = 591
- σ^2 = (Σ x^2·f)/N − μ^2 = 591/32 − (125/32)^2
- Compute 591/32 = 18.46875
- Compute μ^2 = (125/32)^2 = 15625/1024 = 15.2587890625
- σ^2 = 18.46875 − 15.2587890625 = 3.2099609375 hours^2
- Round to sensible precision: σ^2 ≈ 3.210 hours^2.

5) Standard deviation:
- σ = sqrt(3.2099609375) ≈ 1.791636...
- Rounded to three decimal places: σ ≈ 1.792 hours.

Step 5: Final Answer
- Range = 9 hours.
- Interquartile range (IQR) = 2 hours (Q1 = 3 h, Q3 = 5 h).
- Variance (population) ≈ 3.210 hours^2.
- Standard deviation ≈ 1.792 hours.
- Most appropriate measure of dispersion: the interquartile range (IQR). Reason: the data are slightly skewed to the right and include a high value (10 hours) that acts like an outlier; IQR (paired with the median) is robust to such outliers and better represents the typical spread of the central 50% of pupils' revision times.

  - up to 17: 92 (positions 72–92)
  - up to 18: 100 (positions 93–100)
- Total n = 100.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: For each data set (a) and (b), calculate
  - the range (max − min) and
  - the interquartile range (IQR = Q3 − Q1).
- Give answers with correct units (cm for diameters, years for ages).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Range = maximum value − minimum value.
- For even total n, split data into lower half (positions 1 to n/2) and upper half (positions n/2+1 to n). Then:
  - Q1 = median of lower half = average of the two middle values of the lower half.
  - Q3 = median of upper half = average of the two middle values of the upper half.
- For n even, these correspond to overall positions:
  - Q1 uses overall positions n/4 and n/4 + 1 (equivalently the  (n/2)/2 and that +1), or more directly find the two middle positions in the lower half.
  - Q3 uses overall positions n - n/4 and n - n/4 + 1 (equivalently positions n/2 + n/4 and n/2 + n/4 + 1). Practical approach: locate positions by cumulative frequencies.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.

(a) Diameters
- Range:
  - min = 6.0 cm, max = 7.2 cm
  - Range = 7.2 − 6.0 = 1.2 cm

- IQR:
  - n = 80 (even). Lower half positions: 1–40, upper half: 41–80.
  - Q1 is median of positions 1–40 ⇒ average of overall positions 20 and 21.
    - From cumulative frequencies: positions 16–27 are 6.4, so positions 20 and 21 are both 6.4.
    - Q1 = (6.4 + 6.4)/2 = 6.4 cm.
  - Q3 is median of positions 41–80 ⇒ average of overall positions 60 and 61.
    - From cumulative frequencies: positions 46–65 are 6.8, so positions 60 and 61 are both 6.8.
    - Q3 = (6.8 + 6.8)/2 = 6.8 cm.
  - IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 6.8 − 6.4 = 0.4 cm.

(b) Ages
- Range:
  - min = 13 years, max = 18 years
  - Range = 18 − 13 = 5 years

- IQR:
  - n = 100 (even). Lower half positions: 1–50, upper half: 51–100.
  - Q1 is median of positions 1–50 ⇒ average of overall positions 25 and 26.
    - From cumulative frequencies: positions 13–30 are age 14, so positions 25 and 26 are both 14.
    - Q1 = (14 + 14)/2 = 14 years.
  - Q3 is median of positions 51–100 ⇒ average of overall positions 75 and 76.
    - From cumulative frequencies: positions 72–92 are age 17, so positions 75 and 76 are both 17.
    - Q3 = (17 + 17)/2 = 17 years.

- (a) Diameters: Range = 1.2 cm. Interquartile range = 0.4 cm.
- (b) Ages: Range = 5 years. Interquartile range = 3 years.

Strategy evaluation (after solution):

  - Strategy [ID:ee784bf7-a529-49e6-8b23-05fd26f27113] (Verify final answer matches question format and units) was helpful to ensure units (cm, years) were included.

- Type of diagram: A simple table of raw data (list of masses for two teams).
- Extracted data (all masses in kg):
  - Team A: 48, 53, 65, 69, 70
  - Team B: 45, 47, 68, 70, 75
- Other visible features: Each team has 5 players (n = 5).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
The question asks:
(a) For each team, calculate mean, range, variance and standard deviation.
(b) Decide whether the range is an appropriate measure of dispersion for the data and justify the answer.
(c) Determine which team’s masses show greater dispersion from the mean.

Note: I will compute variance and standard deviation using the population formula (variance = sum of squared deviations divided by n) because the problem gives the entire set of players for each team. If a sample-based answer (divide by n − 1) is required instead, those values are also noted below.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
Formulas used:
- Mean: x̄ = (sum of values) / n
- Range: R = max − min
- Population variance: σ^2 = (1/n) Σ (xi − x̄)^2
- Population standard deviation: σ = sqrt(σ^2)
(If using sample variance: s^2 = (1/(n−1)) Σ (xi − x̄)^2 and s = sqrt(s^2).)

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

Team A
1. Compute sum and mean:
   Sum = 48 + 53 + 65 + 69 + 70 = 305
   Mean x̄ = 305 / 5 = 61 kg

2. Range:
   Range = max − min = 70 − 48 = 22 kg

3. Deviations from mean and squared deviations:
   48 − 61 = −13 → (−13)^2 = 169
   53 − 61 = −8  → 64
   65 − 61 = 4   → 16
   69 − 61 = 8   → 64
   70 − 61 = 9   → 81
   Sum of squared deviations = 169 + 64 + 16 + 64 + 81 = 394

4. Population variance and standard deviation:
   σ_A^2 = 394 / 5 = 78.8 (kg^2)
   σ_A = sqrt(78.8) ≈ 8.88 kg

5. (If sample variance requested)
   s_A^2 = 394 / (5 − 1) = 394 / 4 = 98.5 (kg^2)
   s_A = sqrt(98.5) ≈ 9.92 kg

Team B
1. Compute sum and mean:
   Sum = 45 + 47 + 68 + 70 + 75 = 305
   Mean x̄ = 305 / 5 = 61 kg

2. Range:
   Range = max − min = 75 − 45 = 30 kg

3. Deviations from mean and squared deviations:
   45 − 61 = −16 → 256
   47 − 61 = −14 → 196
   68 − 61 = 7   → 49
   70 − 61 = 9   → 81
   75 − 61 = 14  → 196
   Sum of squared deviations = 256 + 196 + 49 + 81 + 196 = 778

4. Population variance and standard deviation:
   σ_B^2 = 778 / 5 = 155.6 (kg^2)
   σ_B = sqrt(155.6) ≈ 12.48 kg

5. (If sample variance requested)
   s_B^2 = 778 / (5 − 1) = 778 / 4 = 194.5 (kg^2)
   s_B = sqrt(194.5) ≈ 13.94 kg

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) Using population formulas (divide by n):
- Team A: mean = 61 kg; range = 22 kg; variance = 78.8 kg^2; standard deviation ≈ 8.88 kg.
- Team B: mean = 61 kg; range = 30 kg; variance = 155.6 kg^2; standard deviation ≈ 12.48 kg.

(If the sample formulas were required instead, Team A: variance = 98.5 kg^2, sd ≈ 9.92 kg; Team B: variance = 194.5 kg^2, sd ≈ 13.94 kg.)

(b) Is range appropriate as a measure of dispersion here?
- The range is simple but not very appropriate as the sole measure of dispersion because it depends only on the two extreme values and ignores the distribution of the remaining data. It is sensitive to outliers. For these small samples, the range gives some information (Team B’s range is larger), but variance and standard deviation give a better picture of how masses vary about the mean.

(c) Which team has greater dispersion from the mean?
- Team B has greater dispersion: σ_B^2 = 155.6 kg^2 and σ_B ≈ 12.48 kg are both larger than Team A’s σ_A^2 = 78.8 kg^2 and σ_A ≈ 8.88 kg. (Same conclusion if using sample variance: Team B’s sample variance and sd are larger.)

- Goal: Find the probability that the result is either (a) the letter ""S"" from box K OR (b) a multiple of 3 from box L (i.e., the number 6). That is P(A ∪ B) where A = {K-card is S} and B = {L-card is a multiple of 3}.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Use the union formula: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B).
- Alternatively count favorable ordered outcomes among the 12 possible pairs.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
Method A: Counting outcomes
- Outcomes with K = S: (S,4), (S,5), (S,6) → 3 outcomes.
- Outcomes with L = 6: (S,6), (E,6), (R,6), (I,6) → 4 outcomes.
- Union count = 3 + 4 − 1 (overlap (S,6) counted twice) = 6 favorable outcomes.
- Probability = favorable / total = 6 / 12 = 1/2.

Method B: Using probabilities
- P(A) = probability K = S = 1/4.
- P(B) = probability L is multiple of 3 (only 6) = 1/3.
- P(A ∩ B) = P(A)·P(B) (independent draws) = (1/4)(1/3) = 1/12.
- P(A ∪ B) = 1/4 + 1/3 − 1/12 = (3 + 4 − 1)/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.

    - P(RM10 | B) = 20/30 = 2/3.
    - P(RM50 | B) = 10/30 = 1/3.
- Given estimate: 450 customers will spend more than RM200 (i.e., 450 spins/customers).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal: Calculate how many RM10 vouchers the Naga Shop needs to prepare for the estimated 450 customers (i.e., expected number of RM10 vouchers that will be selected).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Overall probability that a single customer selects an RM10 voucher:
  P(RM10) = P(red) * P(RM10 | A) + P(yellow) * P(RM10 | B).
- Number of RM10 vouchers needed = expected number = 450 * P(RM10).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Probabilities from the spinner:
   - P(red) = 2/6 = 1/3.
   - P(yellow) = 4/6 = 2/3.
2. Conditional probabilities from boxes:
   - P(RM10 | A) = 5/25 = 1/5.
   - P(RM10 | B) = 20/30 = 2/3.
3. Compute P(RM10):
   - P(RM10) = (1/3)*(1/5) + (2/3)*(2/3).
   - (1/3)*(1/5) = 1/15.
   - (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9.
   - Convert to common denominator 45: 1/15 = 3/45, 4/9 = 20/45.
   - P(RM10) = 3/45 + 20/45 = 23/45.
4. Expected number for 450 customers:
   - Number = 450 * (23/45).

  - Total badminton clubs = 14 + 11 + 3 + 5 = 33
  - Total bodybuilding clubs = 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
- We select one badminton club and one bodybuilding club at random (independently) from the clubs in the four states.
- (a) Find the probability both selected clubs are from Kedah (i.e., badminton from Kedah AND bodybuilding from Kedah).
- (b) Find the probability that the badminton club is from the Federal Territories (either Labuan or Putrajaya collectively) and the bodybuilding club is from Negeri Sembilan (the phrase “respectively” maps the first selection = badminton to the first region = Federal Territories, and the second = bodybuilding to Negeri Sembilan).

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
- Let B_total = total badminton clubs = 33, BB_total = total bodybuilding clubs = 12.
- (a) P(both from Kedah) = P(badminton from Kedah) × P(bodybuilding from Kedah)
  = (number of Kedah badminton / B_total) × (number of Kedah bodybuilding / BB_total).
- (b) P(badminton from Federal Territories and bodybuilding from Negeri Sembilan)
  = (number of badminton in Federal Territories / B_total) × (number of bodybuilding in Negeri Sembilan / BB_total).

Step 4 — Step-by-Step Calculation
(a)
- Number of Kedah badminton = 14, number of Kedah bodybuilding = 6.
- P(badminton from Kedah) = 14 / 33.
- P(bodybuilding from Kedah) = 6 / 12 = 1/2.
- Multiply: P = (14/33) × (1/2) = 14 / 66 = simplify by 2 => 7 / 33.
- Decimal ≈ 7 ÷ 33 ≈ 0.21212 (≈ 0.212).

(b)
- Number of badminton in Federal Territories = Labuan(3) + Putrajaya(5) = 8.
- Number of bodybuilding in Negeri Sembilan = 2.
- P(badminton from FT) = 8 / 33.
- P(bodybuilding from Negeri Sembilan) = 2 / 12 = 1 / 6.
- Multiply: P = (8/33) × (1/6) = 8 / 198 = simplify by 2 => 4 / 99.
- Decimal ≈ 4 ÷ 99 ≈ 0.040404 (≈ 0.0404).

Step 5 — Final Answer
- (a) Probability both selected clubs are from Kedah = 7/33 ≈ 0.212 (about 21.2%).
- (b) Probability badminton club from the Federal Territories and bodybuilding club from Negeri Sembilan = 4/99 ≈ 0.0404 (about 4.04%).

Strategy evaluation (which strategies were helpful or harmful)
- Helpful:
  - Counting totals from the bar chart and separating badminton vs bodybuilding counts — essential and correct.
  - Treating the two selections as independent (one from badminton set, one from bodybuilding set) — appropriate given the problem statement.
  - Using multiplication rule for independent events to compute joint probabilities.
  - [ID:9d1aa487-adf1-4e6e-8f34-3cf2df9aee40] Verifying final answers are given in probability form (fractions) and with decimal approximations — matched the required format.
- Potentially harmful / ambiguous:
  - Interpretation of the phrase in (b). I assumed “respectively” maps the badminton selection to the Federal Territories and the bodybuilding selection to Negeri Sembilan (consistent with the order in the question). If the intended meaning was instead “one club from the Federal Territories and one from Negeri Sembilan in either order,” the probability would be slightly different; that alternate interpretation would need clarifying from the question poser.",wrong,5.246243953704834,3,5,"Total marks available = 5 (ground-truth marking note: full mark 5 if answers match).

- Type of diagram: Table of monthly expenses (a simple budget table).
- Extracted key features from the table and problem text:
  - Income sources:
    - Monthly net salary = RM 3,800
    - Monthly commission (part-time) = RM 450
    - Rental from second house = RM 600
  - Monthly expenses listed:
    - Housing loan instalment (1) = RM 800
    - Housing loan instalment (2) = RM 500
    - Food expenses = RM 900
    - Utility payments = RM 150
    - Toll and petrol expenses = RM 200
    - Internet service subscription = RM 100
    - Eat at a luxury restaurant = RM 400
    - Insurance expenses = RM 350
  - Savings rule: Encik Nabil sets aside 10% of his salary as fixed monthly savings (10% of RM 3,800).
- No other labeled points or graphical elements.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Part (a) goal: Create a monthly personal financial plan for Encik Nabil — present his monthly income, savings, itemized expenses, and resulting balance and suggested allocation of any surplus.
- Part (b) goal: Give comments on whether the plan yields a surplus or deficit and interpret the financial implications (recommendations).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Compute total monthly income:
  Total income = salary + commission + rental.
- Compute fixed monthly savings:
  Savings = 10% of salary = 0.10 × salary.
- Compute total monthly expenses (sum of listed expenses).
- Compute total outflow = total expenses + savings.
- Compute monthly surplus/deficit = total income − total outflow.
- If surplus > 0, classify as surplus and suggest uses; if < 0, classify as deficit and suggest adjustments.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Total monthly income:
   - Salary = RM 3,800
   - Commission = RM 450
   - Rental = RM 600
   Total income = 3,800 + 450 + 600 = RM 4,850

2. Fixed monthly savings (10% of salary):
   Savings = 0.10 × 3,800 = RM 380

3. Sum itemized monthly expenses:
   - Housing loan (1) = 800
   - Housing loan (2) = 500
   - Food = 900
   - Utility = 150
   - Toll & petrol = 200
   - Internet = 100
   - Luxury restaurant = 400
   - Insurance = 350
   Total expenses = 800 + 500 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
                  = 3,400

4. Total monthly outflow:
   Total outflow = Total expenses + Savings = 3,400 + 380 = RM 3,780

5. Monthly surplus/deficit:
   Surplus = Total income − Total outflow = 4,850 − 3,780 = RM 1,070

Step 5: Final Answer
- Monthly personal financial plan (summary):
  - Total monthly income = RM 4,850
    - Salary = RM 3,800
    - Commission = RM 450
    - Rental = RM 600
  - Fixed monthly savings (10% of salary) = RM 380
  - Monthly expenses (itemized) = RM 3,400
  - Total outflow (expenses + savings) = RM 3,780
  - Monthly surplus = RM 1,070

- Comments on surplus/deficit (part (b)):
  - The plan yields a monthly surplus of RM 1,070, so Encik Nabil is not in deficit.
  - Suggested uses for the RM 1,070 surplus:
    - Build an emergency fund (recommend 3–6 months of essential expenses).
    - Accelerate payment on housing loans (reduce interest and shorten loan term).
    - Increase investments or retirement savings.
    - Reallocate part to increase monthly savings percentage (e.g., raise from 10% to 15–20%) or reduce discretionary spending (e.g., luxury restaurant RM 400).
  - If his goals are to pay off debt faster or increase liquid savings, directing a portion of the surplus to extra loan repayment and a portion to a high-interest savings/investment account is advisable.

Chapter 10_Q2.png,"(a) Mrs Thong does not spend wisely because her
total monthly savings of RM250 compared to the
income of RM6 000 which is less than 10%.
(b) Mrs Thong will not be able to achieve the
investment goal of RM500 000 with monthly
savings of RM250","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Financial plan table (monthly budget).
- Key features extracted from the table (all amounts in RM, assumed monthly):
  - Net income: Mrs Thong’s salary = 6 000
  - Expenses (monthly):
    - House/apartment loan, including maintenance = 500
    - Car instalment = 700
    - Travel = 500
    - Rental = 1 500
    - Transport fares = 900
    - Utility bills = 250
    - Toll payments = 100
    - Groceries = 400
    - Allowances for parents = 600
    - Savings = 100
    - Insurance = 200
  - Total expenses (given) = 5 750
  - Mrs Thong’s income balance (monthly) = 250
- Checked arithmetic: sum of listed expenses = 500+700+500+1500+900+250+100+400+600+100+200 = 5 750. Income 6 000 − expenses 5 750 = 250 (matches table).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Determine whether Mrs Thong spends her money wisely (qualitative judgement supported by quantitative measures from the table).
- (b) Determine whether, with her current spending behaviour, she can buy a property worth RM500,000 within 6 years. That requires checking if her current savings pattern will accumulate RM500,000 in 6 years.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Monthly savings allocated in the budget = 100 RM (explicit).
- Time horizon = 6 years = 6 × 12 = 72 months.
- Accumulated savings in 6 years with current monthly savings (assuming no investment return) = monthly_savings × 72 = 100 × 72.
- Required monthly saving to reach RM500,000 in 72 months (assuming no interest) = 500,000 / 72.
- Also compare required monthly savings with her monthly salary and current disposable balance.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Verify monthly leftover and savings:
   - Monthly income = 6 000
   - Monthly total expenses = 5 750
   - Monthly leftover (income balance) = 6 000 − 5 750 = 250 (matches table).
   - Monthly amount specifically labeled ""Savings"" = 100.

2) Accumulated savings in 6 years at current monthly savings:
   - Monthly savings = 100
   - Months in 6 years = 72
   - Accumulated = 100 × 72 = 7 200 RM.

3) Shortfall relative to RM500,000 target:
   - Required total = 500 000
   - Shortfall = 500 000 − 7 200 = 492 800 RM.

4) Required monthly saving (no interest) to reach RM500,000 in 6 years:
   - Required monthly = 500 000 / 72 ≈ 6 944.444... ≈ 6 944.44 RM per month.
   - Compare to monthly salary 6 000: required monthly saving > monthly salary, so infeasible.
   - Compare to current disposable (income balance) 250: required monthly saving (≈ 6 944) ≫ 250, so current behaviour far from sufficient.

5) Savings rate and budget balance for (a):
   - Savings as percentage of income = 100 / 6 000 = 0.016666... = 1.67% (very low).
   - Total expenses as percentage of income = 5 750 / 6 000 = 0.958333... = 95.83% (high).
   - Monthly discretionary leftover = 250 (4.17% of income) and most is not currently allocated to savings (only 100 is allocated).

Step 5: Final Answer
(a) Does Mrs Thong spend her money wisely?
- Quantitatively: No, her savings rate is very low (only RM100 per month, 1.67% of income) and she spends about 95.8% of her income on expenses. She has only RM250 left each month (4.17% of income) after expenses. This is not a prudent long-term saving behavior. Qualitatively: she should increase savings, reduce discretionary or high recurring expenses (e.g., review rental, transport, car instalment, allowances) to build an emergency fund and long-term savings. Therefore: she is not spending wisely for long‑term goals.

(b) Will she be able to buy a RM500,000 property in 6 years with her current spending behaviour?
- No. At her current savings rate (RM100/month) she will save RM7,200 in 6 years, far short of RM500,000 (shortfall RM492,800). Even if she saved the entire monthly leftover (RM250/month) for 72 months she would accumulate 250 × 72 = RM18,000, still far short. The required monthly saving to reach RM500,000 in 6 years (ignoring investment returns) is about RM6,944.44, which exceeds her monthly salary (RM6,000) and is therefore impossible under current income and spending. Conclusion: she cannot achieve that goal with her current spending behaviour.
