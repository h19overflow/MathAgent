- We are given a rectangle with length (x + 20) m and width (x + 5) m.
- (a) asks for an expression/function for the area A (in m^2).
- (b) imposes that the area equals 250 m^2 and asks for the resulting quadratic equation in standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Step 2: Mathematical formulation
- For a rectangle, area = length × width.
- So A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5).

Step 3: Solution execution (showing all algebra)
(a) Multiply out the factors:
A(x) = (x + 20)(x + 5)
= x·x + x·5 + 20·x + 20·5
= x^2 + 5x + 20x + 100
= x^2 + 25x + 100.
So A = x^2 + 25x + 100 (m^2).

(b) Set the area equal to 250 and put into standard quadratic form:
x^2 + 25x + 100 = 250
Subtract 250 from both sides:
x^2 + 25x + 100 − 250 = 0
x^2 + 25x − 150 = 0.

Step 4: Final answers
(a) A(x) = x^2 + 25x + 100 (m^2).

- We are given f(x) = −x^2 + 6x − 5, a horizontal line AB (so AB is y = k for some constant k), and points A and B are the intersections of that horizontal line with the parabola. The diagram states AB lies below the x-axis (so k < 0) and A is to the left of the y-axis (so x-coordinate of A < 0). The y-value k of AB is not numerically given, so A and B cannot be given as specific numeric pairs unless k is specified.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- Intersections solve −x^2 + 6x − 5 = k.
- Rearranged: −x^2 + 6x − (5 + k) = 0. Multiply by −1: x^2 − 6x + (5 + k) = 0.
- Discriminant D = (−6)^2 − 4·1·(5 + k) = 36 − 20 − 4k = 16 − 4k = 4(4 − k).
- Real intersections exist when D ≥ 0 ⇔ 4 − k ≥ 0 ⇔ k ≤ 4 (which is expected since the vertex y = 4 is the maximum of the parabola).

Solve roots:
x = [6 ± sqrt(36 − 4(5 + k))]/2 = [6 ± sqrt(16 − 4k)]/2 = 3 ± sqrt(4 − k).

Thus the two intersection points are
A = (3 − sqrt(4 − k), k) and B = (3 + sqrt(4 − k), k), for any k ≤ 4. If k < 4 the intersections are two distinct points.

Step 3 — Use given diagram constraints
- The axis of symmetry (vertical line through the vertex) is x = −b/(2a) with a = −1, b = 6:
  x = −6/(2·(−1)) = 3. So axis is x = 3.
- The maximum (vertex) P is at x = 3. Compute f(3):
  f(3) = −(3)^2 + 6·3 − 5 = −9 + 18 − 5 = 4. So P = (3, 4).
- Because the diagram says A is left of the y-axis (x_A < 0), impose 3 − sqrt(4 − k) < 0.
  Solve: sqrt(4 − k) > 3 ⇒ 4 − k > 9 ⇒ k < −5.
  So the diagram information (A left of y-axis and AB below the x-axis) implies k < −5. (Note: the parabola crosses the y-axis at (0, −5). Any horizontal line with k < −5 lies below that point, producing intersection x-values with x_A < 0 and x_B > 6.)
- If one (incorrectly) assumed k = −5, the intersections would be x = 3 ± sqrt(4 − (−5)) = 3 ± 3, i.e. x = 0 and x = 6, giving A = (0, −5) and B = (6, −5). But that contradicts the stated position “A is left of the y-axis.” Therefore k = −5 is not consistent with the given diagram description.

Step 4 — Final answers
(a) Coordinates of A: A = (3 − sqrt(4 − k), k). Because the diagram states A is left of the y‑axis, k must satisfy k < −5, so x_A < 0 in that case. Without a numeric value for k, A cannot be given as a single numeric pair.

(b) Equation of the axis of symmetry: x = 3.

(c) Coordinates of B: B = (3 + sqrt(4 − k), k). With the diagram’s information k < −5, x_B > 6. Without a numeric k we cannot give a single numeric pair.

(d) Coordinates of the maximum point P: P = (3, 4).

Summary note: Parts (b) and (d) are fully determined numerically. Parts (a) and (c) can only be given parametrically in terms of k (the y-value of AB). The extra diagram constraint that A lies left of the y-axis implies k < −5, which rules out the specific case k = −5 (A = (0, −5), B = (6, −5)).",wrong,5.16184401512146,3,6,"Total mark = 6.

Chapter 1_Q3.png,20 cm,"Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must find the difference in perimeter between the isosceles triangle (Diagram 1) and the square (Diagram 2).
- Given: base of triangle = 4y cm, height of triangle = (y + 5) cm, square side = y cm, and Area(triangle) − Area(square) = 39 cm^2.
- Constraint: y > 0 (length).

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- Area of triangle = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 4y × (y + 5) = 2y(y + 5) = 2y^2 + 10y.
- Area of square = y^2.
- Given difference: (2y^2 + 10y) − y^2 = 39 ⇒ y^2 + 10y = 39.

Step 3 — Solve for y
- Form quadratic: y^2 + 10y − 39 = 0.
- Use quadratic formula: y = [−10 ± sqrt(10^2 − 4·1·(−39))]/2 = [−10 ± sqrt(100 + 156)]/2 = [−10 ± sqrt(256)]/2 = [−10 ± 16]/2.
- Two solutions: y = (−10 + 16)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or y = (−10 − 16)/2 = −13 (reject since length must be positive).
- So y = 3 cm.

Step 4 — Compute perimeters
Triangle:
- Base = 4y = 12 cm.
- Height = y + 5 = 8 cm.
- In an isosceles triangle the altitude bisects the base, so half-base = 6 cm.
- Slanted side = sqrt((half-base)^2 + (height)^2) = sqrt(6^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10 cm.
- Triangle perimeter = 12 + 10 + 10 = 32 cm.

Square:
- Side = y = 3 cm.
- Square perimeter = 4y = 12 cm.

Difference in perimeter:
- 32 cm − 12 cm = 20 cm.

- We must find the average number of visitors per day in January, given the total 20202_5 and the zoo opens every day.
- Constraint: January has 31 days; final answer must be given in base five.

Step 2: Mathematical formulation
- Convert the base-5 total 20202_5 to base 10.
  20202_5 = 2·5^4 + 0·5^3 + 2·5^2 + 0·5^1 + 2·5^0

Step 2: Mathematical formulation

- Constraint: largest semicircle radius = 32 cm; each next semicircle has diameter equal to the previous radius, so radii halve each step.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- For a semicircle of radius r, its perimeter (arc + straight diameter) is:
  P = (arc length) + (diameter) = πr + 2r = r(π + 2).
- Radii sequence (using the natural convention that the largest semicircle is the 1st, i.e. n = 1):
  r1 = 32 cm,
  r2 = 16 cm,
  r3 = 8 cm,
  r4 = 4 cm,
  and in general rn = 32 · (1/2)^{(n−1)} = 32 / 2^{n−1} = 2^{6−n} cm.
- Then Pn = rn(π + 2) = 2^{6−n}(π + 2).

(If one instead labels the largest semicircle as n = 0, then rn = 2^{5−n} and Pn = 2^{5−n}(π+2). The given form 2^{6−n}(π+2) corresponds to the convention with the largest semicircle indexed n = 1.)

Step 3 — Solution execution

(a) Perimeters of the first four semicircles (using largest = 1):

- Semicircle 3: r3 = 8  → P3 = 8(π + 2)  = 8π + 16.
- Semicircle 4: r4 = 4  → P4 = 4(π + 2)  = 4π + 8.

(b) Generalisation
- From rn = 32 · (1/2)^{(n−1)} = 2^{6−n} and Pn = rn(π + 2), we get
  Pn = 2^{6−n}(π + 2), for n = 1, 2, 3, … .

- (b) Using that formula, find how many cylinders are in Box 8 and compute the total volume when each cylinder has radius 14 cm and height 10 cm. All cylinders are identical.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- The given sequence of counts is 3, 5, 7, 9, … for Box 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 3 and common difference 2.
- Conjecture (closed form): number of cylinders in Box n is a_n = 2n + 1.

Step 3 — Proof by induction (showing all steps)

Base case (n = 1):
- For n = 1, formula gives a_1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.
- This matches the diagram (Box 1 has 3 cylinders). So the base case holds.

Induction step:
- Induction hypothesis: assume for some integer k ≥ 1 that a_k = 2k + 1.
- The pattern increases by 2 from one box to the next, so
  a_{k+1} = a_k + 2.
- Substitute the induction hypothesis:
  a_{k+1} = (2k + 1) + 2 = 2k + 3 = 2(k + 1) + 1.
- Thus if the formula holds for k it holds for k+1.

Conclusion by induction:
- By mathematical induction, a_n = 2n + 1 for all positive integers n.

Step 4 — Volume calculation for Box 8

1. Number of cylinders in Box 8:
   a_8 = 2(8) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 cylinders.

2. Volume of one cylinder:
   V_one = π r^2 h
         = π × (14 cm)^2 × 10 cm
         = π × 196 × 10 cm^3
         = 1960 π cm^3.

   (Shown multiplication: 14^2 = 196; 196 × 10 = 1960.)

3. Total volume for 17 cylinders:
   V_total = 17 × 1960 π cm^3

Chapter 4_Q1.png,x = 3,"Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must find x given a 3-set Venn diagram where ξ = J ∪ K ∪ L and n(ξ) = 25.
- The diagram shows only the following (disjoint) region counts:
  - J only = 7
  - J ∩ K only = 2
  - K only = x + 2
  - K ∩ L only = 3
  - L only = x + 5
  - J ∩ L only = 0 (not shown)
  - J ∩ K ∩ L = 0 (not shown)
- Constraint: the sum of these disjoint region counts equals 25.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
Sum the shown disjoint region counts:
7 (J only) + 2 (J∩K) + (x+2) (K only) + 3 (K∩L) + (x+5) (L only) = 25.

Step 3 — Solution execution (explicit arithmetic)
Combine constants and x-terms:
7 + 2 + (x + 2) + 3 + (x + 5) = 25
=> (7 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5) + (x + x) = 25
=> 19 + 2x = 25
Subtract 19 from both sides:
2x = 25 − 19 = 6
Divide by 2:
x = 6 / 2 = 3

Verify nonnegativity and total:
K only = x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
L only = x + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8
Total = 7 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 25 (matches n(ξ)).

Chapter 4_Q2.png,39,"Step 1: Problem understanding
- We must find n(ξ), the total number of elements in the universal set, using the given Venn-region labels and the constraint n(Q) = n((P ∪ R)').
- The only algebraic constraint given is n(Q) = n((P ∪ R)') (complement taken w.r.t. ξ).
- The region ""R only"" has no numeric label, so treat it as an unknown; call it x. (If the diagram implicitly means unlabeled = 0, we will note that assumption at the end.)

Step 2: Mathematical formulation (identify which regions belong to which sets and to the complement)
Label the seven named regions and the unknown as:
- A = P only = 3
- B = P ∩ Q only = 2
- C = Q only = 4k
- D = P ∩ R only = k
- E = P ∩ Q ∩ R = 1
- F = Q ∩ R only = 5
- G = outside all three = 2k
- H = R only = x (unknown)

Which regions are in Q? Q = C + B + F + E = 4k + 2 + 5 + 1 = 4k + 8.

Which regions are in (P ∪ R)'? (P ∪ R)' are elements not in P and not in R. These are exactly the regions outside P and R: C (Q only) and G (outside all). So
n((P ∪ R)') = C + G = 4k + 2k = 6k.

Step 3: Solve the constraint and compute total
Use n(Q) = n((P ∪ R)'):
4k + 8 = 6k
8 = 2k
k = 4.

Now sum all regions to get n(ξ). Sum = A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H
= 3 + 2 + 4k + k + 1 + 5 + 2k + x
Combine constants and k-terms: (3+2+1+5) + (4k + k + 2k) + x = 11 + 7k + x.
Plug k = 4: 11 + 7(4) + x = 11 + 28 + x = 39 + x.

Step 4: Final answer
- In general n(ξ) = 39 + x, where x is the (unknown) number of elements in the R-only region.
- If the unlabeled R-only region is intended to be 0 (common convention in such diagrams), then x = 0 and n(ξ) = 39.

- We must find (a) the value of y and (b) n(A ∪ B ∪ C).
- Critical constraint: n(B') = n(B ∩ C).
- Universe ξ = A ∪ B ∪ C, so there are no elements outside the three circles.

Step 2: Mathematical formulation (write expressions for region totals)
Label the seven regions and sum them.
- A only = 2
- B only = 4
- C only = 12
- A ∩ B only = y − 2
- A ∩ C only = 5
- B ∩ C only = 9
- A ∩ B ∩ C = y − 1

n(B) = sum of regions inside B:
n(B) = B only + (A ∩ B only) + (B ∩ C only) + (A ∩ B ∩ C)
     = 4 + (y − 2) + 9 + (y − 1)
     = 2y + 10.

Total number in universe (which equals A ∪ B ∪ C):
n(U) = sum of all seven regions
     = 2 + 4 + 12 + (y − 2) + 5 + 9 + (y − 1)
     = 2y + 29.

Thus n(B') = n(U) − n(B) = (2y + 29) − (2y + 10) = 19.

n(B ∩ C) = (B ∩ C only) + (A ∩ B ∩ C) = 9 + (y − 1) = y + 8.

Step 3: Use the constraint n(B') = n(B ∩ C)
Set 19 = y + 8.
Solve: y = 19 − 8 = 11.

- A ∩ B only = y − 2 = 9 ≥ 0
- A ∩ B ∩ C = y − 1 = 10 ≥ 0. Good.

(ii) the route that takes the shortest time.

Step 1: Problem understanding
- We must find, among all directed routes from P to S, (i) the route with minimum total price and (ii) the route with minimum total travel time.
- Important constraint: add 45 minutes = 0.75 hours transit time at any transit airport (Q or R) that the route passes through.

Step 2: Formulate possible routes and their labels
Possible routes from P to S (directed edges only):
1. P → R (RM130, 1.5 h) then R → S (RM65, 1.1 h)
2. P → R (RM130, 1.5 h) then R → S (RM45, 3.0 h)
3. P → R (RM200, 0.8 h) then R → S (RM65, 1.1 h)
4. P → R (RM200, 0.8 h) then R → S (RM45, 3.0 h)
5. P → Q (RM50, 1.0 h) then Q → S (RM115, 1.4 h)

Step 3: Calculate total cost and total time for each route (showing all steps)

Note: transit time = 0.75 h added once for the single transit airport in each route.

Route 1 (P → R (130,1.5) ; R → S (65,1.1)):
- Cost: RM130 + RM65 = RM195.
- Time: flight P→R 1.5 + transit at R 0.75 + flight R→S 1.1
  = 1.5 + 0.75 + 1.1 = 3.35 hours
  = 3 hours + 0.35×60 min = 3 hours 21 minutes.

Route 2 (P → R (130,1.5) ; R → S (45,3.0)):
- Cost: RM130 + RM45 = RM175.
- Time: 1.5 + 0.75 + 3.0 = 5.25 hours
  = 5 hours + 0.25×60 min = 5 hours 15 minutes.

Route 3 (P → R (200,0.8) ; R → S (65,1.1)):
- Cost: RM200 + RM65 = RM265.
- Time: 0.8 + 0.75 + 1.1 = 2.65 hours
  = 2 hours + 0.65×60 min = 2 hours 39 minutes.

Route 4 (P → R (200,0.8) ; R → S (45,3.0)):
- Cost: RM200 + RM45 = RM245.
- Time: 0.8 + 0.75 + 3.0 = 4.55 hours
  = 4 hours + 0.55×60 min = 4 hours 33 minutes.

Route 5 (P → Q (50,1.0) ; Q → S (115,1.4)):
- Cost: RM50 + RM115 = RM165.
- Time: 1.0 + 0.75 + 1.4 = 3.15 hours
  = 3 hours + 0.15×60 min = 3 hours 9 minutes.

Step 4: Determine answers

(i) the most economical route.
- Compare costs: RM195, RM175, RM265, RM245, RM165. Smallest = RM165 (Route 5).
- Therefore the most economical route is: P → Q → S, total cost RM165.

(ii) the route that takes the shortest time.
- Compare times: 3.35 h (3h21m), 5.25 h (5h15m), 2.65 h (2h39m), 4.55 h (4h33m), 3.15 h (3h9m).
- Smallest = 2.65 hours (2 hours 39 minutes), which is Route 3.
- Therefore the quickest route is: P → R → S using P→R (RM200, 0.8 h) then R→S (RM65, 1.1 h), total time 2.65 hours (2 h 39 min). Total cost of that quickest route is RM265.

Chapter 5_Q3.png,"Route A > C > D > E because it is a safer route even
though Lani had to cycle 300 m more","Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must suggest the best directed route from A (home) to E (school) and justify it.
- The graph edges are directed; only routes that follow arrow directions are allowed.
- A qualitative fact is given: BE is a municipal road, and AB, AC, CD, DE are housing-estate roads. This may affect a cyclist’s preference, but no explicit rule (e.g. “avoid municipal roads”) is given.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation (possible directed routes)
- From A to E, following the arrows the feasible routes are:
  1. A → B → E
  2. A → C → D → E
  (No other directed path from A to E exists given the arrows.)
- Write distances in metres:
  AB = 400 m
  BE = 1.1 km = 1100 m
  AC = 350 m
  CD = 800 m
  DE = 650 m

Step 3 — Solution execution (compute total distances)
- Distance of route A → B → E:
  AB + BE = 400 m + 1100 m = 1500 m = 1.5 km.

- Distance of route A → C → D → E:
  AC + CD + DE = 350 m + 800 m + 650 m = 1800 m = 1.8 km.

- Compare:
  1.5 km (A→B→E) versus 1.8 km (A→C→D→E).
  A→B→E is 1800 − 1500 = 300 m shorter (or 0.3 km shorter).

Qualitative consideration (using the municipal vs housing-estate note)
- The BE segment on the shorter route is a municipal road; AB and the three edges of the longer route are housing-estate roads.
- If Lani’s main criterion is shortest distance/time, A→B→E is best (1.5 km).
- If Lani wanted to avoid municipal roads for some reason (e.g. believes they are busier and less comfortable for cycling), she could choose A→C→D→E, but that is 300 m longer.

Step 4 — Final answer
- Recommend route: A → B → E.
- Justification: It is the shortest directed path from A to E (400 + 1100 = 1500 m = 1.5 km), which is 300 m shorter than the alternative A → C → D → E (1.8 km). In addition, the long part BE is a municipal road (likely better surfaced/wider), which may be advantageous for cycling.

Chapter 6_Q1.png,"(a) y < –1, x >= –5, y >= 4
5 x – 1
(b) x >= 2, y >= 0, y < –x + 6","Step 1 — Understand the task
- We must take each shaded triangular region, reflect it in the y-axis (x -> −x), and give the linear inequalities that describe the reflected region.
- Keep the solid/dashed boundaries and filled/open endpoints in mind: solid = inclusive (≤ or ≥), dashed = strict (< or >). Where a dashed boundary meets a solid boundary and a filled point was shown, that single endpoint is included (it is the reflection of a filled point).

Step 2 — Write the inequalities for the original regions

(a) From the diagram the original region satisfies
- On/above the solid slanted line through (0,−1) and (5,−5): y ≥ (−4/5)x − 1.  (solid → ≥)
- Below the dashed horizontal y = −1: y < −1.  (dashed → <)
- To the left of the solid vertical x = 5: x ≤ 5.  (solid → ≤)

So original (a): { y ≥ (−4/5)x − 1, y < −1, x ≤ 5 }.
(Note: the point (5,−1) was shown filled in the picture; it is the intersection of two boundaries where the vertical boundary is solid. In strict inequality notation the dashed horizontal would exclude (5,−1), so to be fully precise one can additionally state that (5,−1) is included. For the inequality system below we keep the boundary conventions as given.)

(b) From the diagram the original region satisfies
- Above the x-axis (solid): y ≥ 0.
- To the left of the solid vertical x = −2: x ≤ −2.
- Below the dashed diagonal y = x + 6: y < x + 6.

So original (b): { y ≥ 0, x ≤ −2, y < x + 6 }.
(Again the point (−2,4) was filled; it lies on the solid vertical and dashed diagonal. The diagonal alone is dashed so would exclude (−2,4), but the vertical boundary includes it; note that (−2,4) is included.)

Step 3 — Reflect each inequality in the y-axis (substitute x_old = −x_new; after reflection rename x_new → x)

(a) Start with
  y ≥ (−4/5)x − 1
  y < −1
  x ≤ 5

Substitute x_old = −x (i.e. replace x by −x) to get the inequalities for the reflected region:
  y ≥ (−4/5)(−x) − 1 = (4/5)x − 1
  y < −1
  −x ≤ 5  ⇒  x ≥ −5

So reflected (a): { y ≥ (4/5)x − 1, y < −1, x ≥ −5 }.
(And the image of the filled point (5,−1) is (−5,−1); that point is included in the picture — it can be listed separately if you need to indicate that single included endpoint despite the dashed horizontal.)

(b) Start with
  y ≥ 0
  x ≤ −2
  y < x + 6

Substitute x_old = −x:
  y ≥ 0
  −x ≤ −2  ⇒  x ≥ 2
  y < (−x) + 6  ⇒  y < −x + 6

So reflected (b): { y ≥ 0, x ≥ 2, y < −x + 6 }.
(The image of the filled point (−2,4) is (2,4); that point is included in the reflected picture by virtue of the solid vertical boundary x = 2.)

Step 4 — Final answers

(a) After reflection in the y-axis:
  y ≥ (4/5)x − 1,
  y < −1,
  x ≥ −5.
(With the image point (−5,−1) included as shown.)

(b) After reflection in the y-axis:
  y ≥ 0,
  x ≥ 2,

Chapter 6_Q2.png,"(a) x + y <= 500 (b) x <= 3y or 3y >= x
(c) y >= 200","Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must write inequalities that describe the shaded triangular region in each diagram (a), (b), (c).
- Pay attention to which boundary lines are included (solid) or excluded (dashed). In (a) the vertical line x = −4 is dashed (so interior points on that vertical are excluded), but the two vertices (-4,0) and (-4,2) lie on other solid boundaries and are shown as included (filled dot at (-4,2)), so they must be included in the region.

Step 2 — mathematical formulation (derive line equations and inclusion)

(a) Geometry and line equations
- Slanted line through (-4,2) and (0,0).
  Slope m = (0 − 2)/(0 − (−4)) = −2/4 = −1/2.
  Equation: y = (−1/2)x.
- x-axis: y = 0.
- Vertical line (dashed): x = −4.
Shading: triangular region with vertices (0,0), (−4,0), (−4,2), bounded by y = 0 (solid), y = −(1/2)x (solid), and x = −4 (dashed). Vertical interior x = −4 is excluded, but the two vertices on the other solid boundaries are included.

Because of the dashed vertical with two included vertices, the region cannot be described exactly by a single conjunction of non-strict linear inequalities alone; we give a precise set description (a union) that matches the diagram:

(a) Final description:
{ (x,y) | −4 < x ≤ 0, 0 ≤ y ≤ −(1/2)x } ∪ { (−4,0), (−4,2) }.

Explanation:
- For interior points of the triangular area we require −4 < x ≤ 0, 0 ≤ y ≤ −(1/2)x (both boundaries y = 0 and y = −(1/2)x included).
- The vertical x = −4 is excluded for interior points (−4 < x), but the two vertices (−4,0) and (−4,2) are explicitly added to the set because they lie on included boundaries.

(If the problem demands only a single conjunction of inequalities and no explicit union/points, note that no such single conjunction can include those two corner points while excluding the interior of x = −4. The union above is the exact description.)

(b) Geometry and line equations
- Left slanted line through (−2,0) and (0,4):
  Slope = (4 − 0)/(0 − (−2)) = 4/2 = 2 → equation y = 2x + 4.
  (Check: x = −2 gives y = 2(−2)+4 = 0; x = 0 gives y = 4.)
- Right slanted line through (3,0) and (0,4):
  Slope = (0 − 4)/(3 − 0) = −4/3 → equation y = −(4/3)x + 4.
- x-axis: y = 0.
Shading: triangle with vertices (−2,0), (0,4), (3,0). All boundary lines are solid (included).

(b) Final inequalities (all boundaries included):
y ≥ 0,
y ≤ 2x + 4,
y ≤ −(4/3)x + 4.

(These three together describe the triangular region: above the x-axis and below both slanted lines.)

(c) Geometry and line equations
- Slanted line through (0, −2) and (3, 1):
  Slope = (1 − (−2))/(3 − 0) = 3/3 = 1 → equation y = x − 2.
  (Also passes through (1, −1), (2, 0).)
- Horizontal top: y = 1.
- y-axis (left boundary): x = 0.
Shading: triangle with vertices (0, −2), (0, 1), (3, 1). All boundaries are solid (included).

(c) Final inequalities (all boundaries included):
x ≥ 0,
y ≤ 1,
y ≥ x − 2.

(These require points to be to the right of the y-axis, below y = 1, and above the slanted line y = x − 2; together they give the triangular region.)

Step 3 — verification
- (a) For a typical interior point e.g. x = −2, the upper bound is y ≤ −(1/2)(−2)=1 and lower bound 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 — inside the triangle. Points with x = −4 and 0 < y < 2 are excluded by x > −4, but (-4,0) and (-4,2) are included explicitly.
- (b) At x = 0, the two upper bounds give y ≤ 4 and y ≥ 0 → 0 ≤ y ≤ 4, matching triangular slice at x = 0.
- (c) At x = 2, y must satisfy x − 2 = 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 → 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, matching the slice through the triangle.

- We must find linear inequalities describing the image of each shaded region after reflection in the x-axis (the map (x,y) -> (x,−y)).
- For each subfigure: (i) write the boundary line equations for the original region; (ii) determine the inequality direction (which side is shaded); (iii) substitute y -> −y to get inequalities for the reflected region; (iv) simplify.

(If a boundary was drawn solid it is included (≤ or ≥); if dashed it would be excluded (< or >). The data notes the points at x = 3 in (a) are marked as included, so I treat x = 3 as included.)

Subfigure (a)

Step 2 — mathematical formulation for the original region
- Slanted solid boundary through (0,0) and (3,3): slope = 3/3 = 1 → equation y = x. The shaded region is below this line → y ≤ x.
- Vertical left boundary is the y-axis x = 0. The shaded region is to the right → x ≥ 0.
- Vertical right boundary is x = 3. The shaded region is to the left → x ≤ 3 (included).
- Horizontal lower boundary y = −2 (solid) and the shaded region is above it → y ≥ −2.

So original region R (a) is:
x ≥ 0, x ≤ 3, y ≥ −2, y ≤ x.

Step 3 — reflect in the x-axis (substitute y -> −y)
Replace y by −y in each inequality:

1) x ≥ 0 stays x ≥ 0 (x unchanged).
2) x ≤ 3 stays x ≤ 3.
3) y ≥ −2 becomes (−y) ≥ −2 → multiply both sides by −1 (reverse inequality): y ≤ 2.
4) y ≤ x becomes (−y) ≤ x → multiply both sides by −1 (reverse inequality): y ≥ −x.

Step 4 — final inequalities for (a) (image region)
0 ≤ x ≤ 3, and −x ≤ y ≤ 2.

Or written as the system:
x ≥ 0,
x ≤ 3,
y ≥ −x,
y ≤ 2.

Subfigure (b)

Step 2 — mathematical formulation for the original triangular region
Find equations of the three boundary lines:

1) Line through O(0,0) and (2,4): slope = 4/2 = 2 → y = 2x.
   The triangle lies below this line → y ≤ 2x.

2) Line through O(0,0) and (4,2): slope = 2/4 = 1/2 → y = (1/2)x.
   The triangle lies above this line → y ≥ (1/2)x.

3) Line through (2,4) and (4,2): slope = (2−4)/(4−2) = −1. Equation:
   y − 4 = −1(x − 2) → y = −x + 6.
   The triangle lies below this line → y ≤ −x + 6.

So original region R (b) is:
y ≥ (1/2)x, y ≤ 2x, y ≤ −x + 6 (equalities included on the boundaries).

Step 3 — reflect in the x-axis (y -> −y)
Substitute y by −y in each inequality:

1) y ≤ 2x becomes (−y) ≤ 2x → multiply by −1: y ≥ −2x.
2) y ≥ (1/2)x becomes (−y) ≥ (1/2)x → multiply by −1: y ≤ −(1/2)x.
3) y ≤ −x + 6 becomes (−y) ≤ −x + 6 → multiply by −1: y ≥ x − 6.

Step 4 — final inequalities for (b) (image region)
The reflected triangle is given by the system:
y ≥ −2x,
y ≤ −(1/2)x,
y ≥ x − 6.

(These inequalities are inclusive of the boundary lines, since the original triangle edges were solid.)

- We must find:
  (a) the rate of change of speed (acceleration) in m s−2 for the first 20 s;
  (b) the distance travelled during the uniform-speed part of the journey;
  (c) a description of the whole 2.5 minute (150 s) journey.
- Non‑standard constraint: 2.5 minutes = 150 s (given).

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation from the graph
- Acceleration segment: straight line from (0,0) to (40,15). Hence v(t) on this segment is linear.
  Equation: slope = Δv/Δt = 15/40 = 0.375, so v = 0.375 t (m s−1) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 40.
- Constant-speed segment: horizontal line v = 15 m s−1 for 40 ≤ t ≤ 120.
- Deceleration segment: straight line from (120,15) to (150,0).
  Slope = (0 − 15)/(150 − 120) = −15/30 = −0.5, so v = 75 − 0.5 t (m s−1) for 120 ≤ t ≤ 150.
- Areas under v–t graph give distances.

Step 3 — Solution execution (showing all steps)

(a) Rate of change of speed for the first 20 s
- Use v = 0.375 t or compute Δv/Δt from (0,0) to (20,7.5):
  v(20) = 0.375 × 20 = 7.5 m s−1.
  Acceleration = Δv/Δt = 7.5 / 20 = 0.375 m s−2.
Answer (a): 0.375 m s−2.

(b) Distance travelled at the uniform speed
- Uniform speed = 15 m s−1 from t = 40 s to t = 120 s → duration = 120 − 40 = 80 s.
- Distance = speed × time = 15 × 80 = 1200 m.
Answer (b): 1200 m.

(c) Describe the 2.5 minute (150 s) journey
- Convert time: 2.5 min = 150 s, so describe t from 0 to 150 s.
- Phase 1 (0 ≤ t ≤ 40 s): Accelerates uniformly from rest to 15 m s−1.
  - Rate = 0.375 m s−2 (from part (a)).
  - Distance in this phase = area of triangle = 1/2 × base 40 × height 15 = 300 m.
- Phase 2 (40 ≤ t ≤ 120 s): Travels at constant speed 15 m s−1 for 80 s.
  - Distance = 15 × 80 = 1200 m.
- Phase 3 (120 ≤ t ≤ 150 s): Decelerates uniformly from 15 m s−1 to rest over 30 s.
  - Deceleration = −0.5 m s−2 (slope computed above).
  - Distance in this phase = area of triangle = 1/2 × 30 × 15 = 225 m.
- Total distance over 150 s (optional check) = 300 + 1200 + 225 = 1725 m.

Answer (c) (concise): From t = 0 to 40 s he accelerates uniformly from rest to 15 m s−1 (acceleration 0.375 m s−2); from 40 to 120 s he travels at a constant 15 m s−1; from 120 to 150 s he decelerates uniformly to rest (deceleration 0.5 m s−2).

- We must find:
  (a) the car’s speed during the first 24 minutes (24 min = 24/60 = 0.4 h),
  (b) the time t where the (magenta) bus is at distance 70 km (Q = (t,70)),
  (c) the car’s speed over the last 80 km of its journey (from 70 km to 150 km).
- The provided diagram text is internally inconsistent if one assumes the car’s path is a single straight line O→R (because P(0.7,70) cannot lie on that single straight O–R line). To obtain a consistent interpretation with the labeled points P(0.7,70) and R(3,150) we adopt the piecewise model used in the feedback: the car travels at a constant speed from O to P (0 → 0.7 h) and a (different) constant speed from P to R (0.7 → 3 h). I will state this assumption explicitly and proceed.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation (under the piecewise-car assumption)
- Car, first segment: O(0,0) → P(0.7,70). Constant speed v1 = (distance change)/(time change) = 70 ÷ 0.7.
- Bus: A(0,150) → B(3,0). Bus distance as function of time: D_bus(t) = 150 + slope × t. Slope = (0 − 150)/(3 − 0) = −150/3 = −50, so D_bus(t) = 150 − 50t. Solve 150 − 50t = 70 for t.
- Car, second segment (last 80 km): P(0.7,70) → R(3,150). Distance change = 150 − 70 = 80 km; time change = 3 − 0.7 = 2.3 h. Speed v2 = 80 ÷ 2.3.

Step 3 — Calculations (all steps shown)
(a) Car’s rate in the first 24 minutes (first 0.4 h).
- First-segment speed v1 = 70 / 0.7 = 100 km h−1.
- Because 0.4 h < 0.7 h, the first 24 minutes lie inside this first segment, so the car’s rate during the first 24 minutes is 100 km h−1.

(b) Value of t (when bus is at distance 70 km).
- D_bus(t) = 150 − 50 t. Set equal to 70:
  150 − 50 t = 70
  −50 t = 70 − 150 = −80
  t = (−80)/(−50) = 80/50 = 8/5 = 1.6 hours.

(c) Car’s rate for the last 80 km.
- Time taken for last 80 km = 3 − 0.7 = 2.3 h.
- Speed v2 = 80 / 2.3 = 800/23 km h−1 ≈ 34.7826 km h−1.

Step 4 — Final answers (with the assumption stated)
Assumption: the car’s path is piecewise-linear with a constant speed from O to P (0 → 0.7 h) and a different constant speed from P to R (0.7 → 3 h). Under that consistent interpretation:
(a) 100 km h−1.
(b) t = 1.6 h.
(c) 800/23 km h−1 ≈ 34.78 km h−1.

Note: If instead the car were required to be a single straight line through O and R, the point P(0.7,70) would not lie on that line and the diagram/data would be inconsistent — the numeric answers above follow from the piecewise interpretation which makes the labelled points consistent.",wrong,4.744286298751831,3,5,"The AI's response has three parts (a), (b), (c).

Chapter 7_Q3.png,(a) 8 seconds (b) 17,"Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must find:
  (a) the duration for which the motorcycle travels at uniform speed (reading from the graph).
  (b) the value(s) of t such that the distances travelled by the car and the motorcycle are equal over the period of t seconds.
- Important constraint (from the validation notes): for part (b) distances must be equated as areas under the speed–time curves over the interval [0, t]. Also the motorcycle’s full speed profile on [0, t] is not fully specified by the diagram (we only see a horizontal segment at 4 m s^-1 between t = 2 and t = 10), so we must state any assumption we use or conclude the problem is underspecified.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- Car: the car’s speed–time graph is the straight line from O = (0,0) to R = (t,10). Its speed at time x (0 ≤ x ≤ t) is v_car(x) = (10/t)·x (linear from 0 to 10).
  - Distance travelled by the car in time t is area under this line (a triangle): 
    distance_car = (1/2) · base · height = (1/2)·t·10 = 5t.
- Motorcycle: the only explicitly shown part is a horizontal segment at speed 4 m s^-1 between P = (2,4) and Q = (10,4). The area under that visible part (from 2 to 10) is 4·(10 − 2) = 4·8 = 32 m.
  - For the motorcycle the full area from 0 to t depends on its speed outside [2,10], which is not given in the diagram. We must therefore either (i) make an explicit assumption about the motorcycle’s motion on [0,2) and (10,t], or (ii) conclude the data are insufficient to determine t uniquely from the distance-equality condition.

Step 3 — Solution execution (explicit cases and algebra)

(a) Duration motorcycle at uniform speed
- From the graph the motorcycle is at 4 m s^-1 from t = 2 to t = 10.
- Duration = 10 − 2 = 8 seconds.
  Answer (a): 8 s.

(b) Equate distances (areas) — discuss ambiguity and possible assumptions

First, a geometric fact from the diagram (useful but not sufficient alone): the car’s line passes through Q = (10,4). Using the car’s equation v_car(x) = (10/t)·x at x = 10 we get
  4 = (10/t)·10  ⇒ 4 = 100/t  ⇒ t = 25.
This t = 25 is the value required so that the car’s straight line (0,0) → (t,10) passes through (10,4). It is a geometric constraint from the shown points.

Now check the distance-equality condition. The car’s distance for t = 25 is
  distance_car = 5t = 5·25 = 125 m.

But the motorcycle’s area that is explicitly shown (from 2 to 10) is 32 m (computed above). To have distances equal over [0, t] the motorcycle must cover total distance 125 m in time 0 → 25. That requires the motorcycle to cover an additional 125 − 32 = 93 m during the periods outside [2,10] (i.e. during [0,2] and/or [10,25]). The graph as given does not specify the motorcycle’s speed in those intervals, so we cannot deduce t from the distance-equality condition alone.

Consider two natural assumptions and their consequences:

Assumption A — motorcycle is at 0 m s^-1 for 0 ≤ time < 2 and at 4 m s^-1 for 2 ≤ time ≤ t (i.e. it starts moving at t = 2 and continues at 4 up to time t):
  distance_motor = 4·(t − 2).
  Equate with distance_car = 5t:
    5t = 4(t − 2)
    5t = 4t − 8
    t = −8 s,
  which is impossible (negative). Hence under this assumption there is no positive t satisfying equal distances.

Assumption B — motorcycle is at 4 m s^-1 only between 2 and 10 and is unspecified (possibly 0 or some other speed) elsewhere:
  We computed the shown part gives 32 m. To get equality with car for t = 25 (the geometric t), the motorcycle would need to travel an extra 93 m on [0,2]∪(10,25], which requires average speed 93/15 = 6.2 m s^-1 over those 15 s. The diagram gives no information that the motorcycle attains that speed, so equality cannot be confirmed.

Conclusion for (b)
- The correct method is to equate areas under the v–t curves. Doing that requires the motorcycle’s speed for the entire interval [0, t]. The diagram only specifies motorcycle speed for 2 ≤ time ≤ 10, so the problem is underspecified as stated: there is not enough information to determine a unique t that satisfies “distances equal over the period of t seconds” unless an extra assumption about the motorcycle’s motion on [0,2) and (10,t] is supplied.
- If one uses only the geometric constraint that the car’s line passes through (10,4), then t = 25 (this follows from the car’s straight line through those points), but t = 25 does not, by itself, guarantee equal distances unless the motorcycle’s unspecified motions give it total distance 125 m by time 25. With only the visible horizontal segment at 4 m s^-1 between 2 and 10, the motorcycle covers 32 m there and so would need an additional 93 m elsewhere to match the car — information not provided.

Step 4 — Final answers
- (a) The motorcycle travels at uniform speed for 10 − 2 = 8 s.
- (b) The distance-equality condition requires equating areas under the two curves. The diagram does not give the motorcycle’s speed for the whole interval [0, t], so part (b) is underspecified and no unique positive value of t can be deduced from the given information alone. (As a geometric fact one finds t = 25 so that the car’s line passes through (10,4); if the motorcycle’s unknown motion outside [2,10] were such that its total distance to time 25 were 125 m then t = 25 would satisfy the distance equality — specifically the motorcycle would need an extra 93 m outside the shown 2–10 interval, e.g. an average of 6.2 m s^-1 over the 15 s from 10 to 25.)

If you can tell me what the motorcycle does before t = 2 and after t = 10 (for example: at rest before 2 and continues at 4 after 10, or continues at 4 for the whole interval 2 ≤ time ≤ t, or some given acceleration), I will compute t explicitly.",wrong,3.376387596130371,2,5,"Total available mark = 5 (full mark only if both parts match the ground truth).

Instead it argued the problem is underspecified, computed the car distance correctly as 5t, computed the visible motorcycle area 32 m for 2–10 s, and noted missing information — demonstrating partial understanding of the method.

(b) interquartile range","Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must find the range, interquartile range (IQR), variance and standard deviation for the discrete frequency distribution of revision times for 32 pupils.  
- No special constraints; the table gives the whole dataset (N = 32).

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- Use the frequency table to compute Σf x and Σf x^2, the mean x̄, then variance σ^2 = (Σf x^2)/N − x̄^2 (population variance, since we have the entire group of 32 pupils).  
- For the IQR, with N = 32 (even), split into lower 16 and upper 16 observations. Q1 is median of observations 1–16 = average of 8th and 9th values; Q3 is median of observations 17–32 = average of 24th and 25th values.

Step 3 — Solution execution (all steps shown)

1) Compute Σf x (sum of values)
- 1×2 = 2
- 2×5 = 10
- 3×6 = 18
- 4×9 = 36
- 5×6 = 30
- 6×2 = 12
- 7×1 = 7
- 10×1 = 10
Sum Σf x = 2 + 10 + 18 + 36 + 30 + 12 + 7 + 10 = 125

Mean x̄ = Σf x / N = 125 / 32 = 3.90625 hours

2) Compute Σf x^2
- 1^2×2 = 2
- 2^2×5 = 4×5 = 20
- 3^2×6 = 9×6 = 54
- 4^2×9 = 16×9 = 144
- 5^2×6 = 25×6 = 150
- 6^2×2 = 36×2 = 72
- 7^2×1 = 49
- 10^2×1 = 100
Sum Σf x^2 = 2 + 20 + 54 + 144 + 150 + 72 + 49 + 100 = 591

3) Population variance
σ^2 = (Σf x^2)/N − x̄^2
= 591/32 − (125/32)^2
= 18.46875 − 15.2734375
= 3.1953125 (hours^2)

Standard deviation σ = sqrt(σ^2) = sqrt(3.1953125) ≈ 1.7875 hours (rounded ≈ 1.788 h)

4) Range
Range = max − min = 10 − 1 = 9 hours

5) Interquartile range (IQR)
- Expanded sorted list positions (1 to 32); the list is:
  1(1), 2(1), 3(2), 4(2), 5(2), 6(2), 7(2), 8(3), 9(3), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 14(4), 15(4), 16(4),
  17(4), 18(4), 19(4), 20(4), 21(4), 22(4), 23(5), 24(5), 25(5), 26(5), 27(5), 28(5), 29(6), 30(6), 31(7), 32(10)
- Q1 = average of 8th and 9th observations = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
- Q3 = average of 24th and 25th observations = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 5 − 3 = 2 hours

Step 4 — Final answers
(a)
- Range = 9 hours  
- Interquartile range (IQR) = 2 hours  
- Variance (population) = 3.1953125 hours^2 (≈ 3.1953)  
- Standard deviation = √3.1953125 ≈ 1.7875 hours (≈ 1.788 h)

(b) Most appropriate measure of dispersion
- The IQR is the most appropriate measure here because the data contain an outlying larger value (10) and the IQR is robust to outliers and skewness. The IQR therefore better represents the spread of the typical pupils' revision times than the variance/SD which are influenced by the outlier.",correct,6.835046768188477,6,6,"Full marks awarded (6/6).

- We must find the range and the interquartile range (IQR) for each frequency distribution.
- No extra constraints.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation (use cumulative frequencies and positions)
- For a dataset of size n, locate quartiles by positions around n/4 and 3n/4 (here the grouped values are discrete so we find which class contains those positions).

(a) Diameters of limes
- Values and frequencies:
  6.0: 6; 6.2: 9; 6.4: 12; 6.6: 18; 6.8: 20; 7.0: 10; 7.2: 5
- Total n = 6+9+12+18+20+10+5 = 80
- Range = max − min = 7.2 − 6.0 = 1.2 cm

Compute cumulative frequencies and positions:
- 6.0: cumulative 6 (positions 1–6)
- 6.2: cumulative 15 (positions 7–15)
- 6.4: cumulative 27 (positions 16–27)
- 6.6: cumulative 45 (positions 28–45)
- 6.8: cumulative 65 (positions 46–65)
- 7.0: cumulative 75 (positions 66–75)
- 7.2: cumulative 80 (positions 76–80)

Quartile positions (using n/4 or (n+1)/4 gives same containing classes here):
- Q1 position ≈ n/4 = 80/4 = 20 → 20th observation lies in 6.4 (positions 16–27) → Q1 = 6.4 cm
- Q3 position ≈ 3n/4 = 3×80/4 = 60 → 60th observation lies in 6.8 (positions 46–65) → Q3 = 6.8 cm

IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 6.8 − 6.4 = 0.4 cm

(a) Answer: range = 1.2 cm; IQR = 0.4 cm

(b) Ages of participants
- Values and frequencies:
  13:12; 14:18; 15:21; 16:20; 17:21; 18:8
- Total n = 12+18+21+20+21+8 = 100
- Range = max − min = 18 − 13 = 5 years

Compute cumulative frequencies and positions:
- 13: cumulative 12 (positions 1–12)
- 14: cumulative 30 (positions 13–30)
- 15: cumulative 51 (positions 31–51)
- 16: cumulative 71 (positions 52–71)
- 17: cumulative 92 (positions 72–92)
- 18: cumulative 100 (positions 93–100)

Quartile positions:
- Q1 position ≈ n/4 = 100/4 = 25 → 25th observation lies in 14 (positions 13–30) → Q1 = 14 years
- Q3 position ≈ 3n/4 = 75 → 75th observation lies in 17 (positions 72–92) → Q3 = 17 years

- We must compute for each team (n = 5): mean, range, variance and standard deviation from the raw data.
- Decide convention: these data describe the whole team (not a sample), so we use the population formulas (divide by n) for variance and standard deviation. Units: masses in kg, variance in kg^2, standard deviation in kg.

Step 2: Mathematical formulation
- Mean μ = (sum of data)/n.
- Range = max − min.
- Population variance σ^2 = (1/n) Σ(xi − μ)^2.
- Population standard deviation σ = √(σ^2).

Step 3: Solution execution (all steps shown)

Team A data: 48, 53, 65, 69, 70. n = 5
1. Mean:
  Sum = 48 + 53 + 65 + 69 + 70 = 305
  Mean μA = 305 / 5 = 61.0 kg

2. Range:
  min = 48, max = 70 → RangeA = 70 − 48 = 22 kg

3. Deviations and squared deviations from mean (61.0):
  48 − 61 = −13 → (−13)^2 = 169
  53 − 61 = −8  → (−8)^2  = 64
  65 − 61 = 4   → 4^2    = 16
  69 − 61 = 8   → 8^2    = 64
  70 − 61 = 9   → 9^2    = 81
  Sum of squared deviations = 169 + 64 + 16 + 64 + 81 = 394

4. Variance (population):
  σA^2 = 394 / 5 = 78.8 kg^2

5. Standard deviation:
  σA = √78.8 ≈ 8.877 kg (≈ 8.88 kg)

Team B data: 45, 47, 68, 70, 75. n = 5
1. Mean:

  σB^2 = 778 / 5 = 155.6 kg^2

5. Standard deviation:
  σB = √155.6 ≈ 12.478 kg (≈ 12.48 kg)

(a)
- Team A: mean = 61.0 kg; range = 22 kg; variance = 78.8 kg^2; standard deviation ≈ 8.88 kg.
- Team B: mean = 61.0 kg; range = 30 kg; variance = 155.6 kg^2; standard deviation ≈ 12.48 kg.

(b) Is the range appropriate as a measure of dispersion for these data?
- The range is simple but only uses the two extreme values and is highly sensitive to outliers. It does not reflect how the other data are spread. Therefore the range alone is not the most appropriate measure of dispersion here; variance or standard deviation (which use all data) give a fuller picture.

(c) Determine which team has greater dispersion from the mean.
- Team B has the greater dispersion from the mean (σB^2 = 155.6 kg^2 and σB ≈ 12.48 kg > σA^2 = 78.8 kg^2 and σA ≈ 8.88 kg).",correct,3.3265984058380127,7,7,"Full marks (7) awarded.

- Selections are independent and each card in a box is equally likely.

Step 2: Mathematical formulation (sample space)
- Box K = {S, E, R, I} (4 cards). Box L = {4, 5, 6} (3 cards).

Chapter 9_Q2.png,230,"Step 1 — Problem understanding
- We must find how many RM10 vouchers Naga Shop needs to prepare for the estimated 450 eligible customers.
- Each eligible customer spins a 6-sector wheel: 2 red sectors and 4 yellow sectors.
- If red → choose from box A; if yellow → choose from box B.
- The vouchers are replaced after selection, so probabilities stay constant (sampling with replacement).

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation
- P(red) = 2/6 = 1/3. P(yellow) = 4/6 = 2/3.
- In box A: total vouchers = 20 (RM50) + 5 (RM10) = 25, so P(RM10 | A) = 5/25 = 1/5.
- In box B: total vouchers = 10 (RM50) + 20 (RM10) = 30, so P(RM10 | B) = 20/30 = 2/3.
- Overall probability a customer gets an RM10 voucher:
  P(RM10) = P(red)·P(RM10 | A) + P(yellow)·P(RM10 | B).

- We select one badminton club and one bodybuilding club at random (independently) from the four listed states.
- We must compute probabilities using the counts shown on the chart.
- Note: ""Federal Territories"" includes F.T. Labuan and F.T. Putrajaya combined. The phrase ""respectively"" ties the order of states to the order of clubs given (badminton then bodybuilding). So for part (b) I take this to mean: the badminton club is from the Federal Territories and the bodybuilding club is from Negeri Sembilan.

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation (counts and totals)
- Badminton clubs by state:
  - Kedah: 14
  - Negeri Sembilan: 11
  - F.T. Labuan: 3
  - F.T. Putrajaya: 5
  - Total badminton = 14 + 11 + 3 + 5 = 33
- Bodybuilding clubs by state:
  - Kedah: 6
  - Negeri Sembilan: 2
  - F.T. Labuan: 2
  - F.T. Putrajaya: 2
  - Total bodybuilding = 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12

Step 3 — Solution execution

(a) Probability both selected clubs are from Kedah
- Probability(badminton from Kedah) = 14 / 33
- Probability(bodybuilding from Kedah) = 6 / 12 = 1/2
- Since selections are independent, multiply:
  P(both from Kedah) = (14/33) * (6/12) = (14/33) * (1/2) = 14/66 = 7/33
- Decimal value ≈ 0.2121

(b) Probability the badminton club is from the Federal Territories and the bodybuilding club is from Negeri Sembilan (interpretation of ""respectively"")
- Total badminton in Federal Territories = 3 (Labuan) + 5 (Putrajaya) = 8
- Probability(badminton from F.T.) = 8 / 33
- Probability(bodybuilding from Negeri Sembilan) = 2 / 12 = 1/6
- Multiply:
  P = (8/33) * (1/6) = 8/198 = 4/99
- Decimal value ≈ 0.04040

(If instead the problem had meant the reverse mapping — badminton from Negeri Sembilan and bodybuilding from the Federal Territories — the probability would be (11/33) * ( (2+2)/12 ) = (11/33) * (4/12) = (11/33) * (1/3) = 11/99.)

improved Encik Nabil’s liquidity","Step 1 — Problem understanding
- Need to produce a monthly personal financial plan for Encik Nabil (list incomes, required fixed savings, expenses, totals) and then comment on whether the plan yields a surplus or deficit.
- Important constraint: he must set aside fixed monthly savings equal to 10% of his salary (10% of RM3 800).

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation (write each income/expense as expressions)
- Monthly incomes:
  - Salary = RM 3 800
  - Commission = RM 450
  - Rental = RM 600
  - Total monthly income = Salary + Commission + Rental

- Fixed monthly savings (constraint):
  - Savings = 10% of salary = 0.10 × RM 3 800

- Monthly expenses (from table):
  - Housing loan instalment (1) = RM 800
  - Housing loan instalment (2) = RM 500
  - Food = RM 900
  - Utility = RM 150
  - Toll & petrol = RM 200
  - Internet = RM 100
  - Eat at a luxury restaurant = RM 400
  - Insurance = RM 350
  - Total listed expenses = sum of the above items

Step 3 — Solution execution (explicit arithmetic)
1. Total monthly income:
   - RM 3 800 + RM 450 + RM 600
   - = RM (3 800 + 450) + 600
   - = RM 4 250 + 600
   - = RM 4 850

2. Fixed monthly savings (10% of salary):
   - 0.10 × RM 3 800 = RM 380

3. Sum of listed monthly expenses:
   - RM 800 + 500 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
   - = (800 + 500) + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
   - = 1 300 + 900 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
   - = 2 200 + 150 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
   - = 2 350 + 200 + 100 + 400 + 350
   - = 2 550 + 100 + 400 + 350
   - = 2 650 + 400 + 350
   - = 3 050 + 350
   - = RM 3 400

4. Total monthly outflows (expenses + fixed savings):
   - RM 3 400 (expenses) + RM 380 (savings)
   - = RM 3 780

5. Monthly surplus / deficit:
   - Total income − Total outflows = RM 4 850 − RM 3 780
   - = RM 1 070
   - Since this is positive, Encik Nabil has a monthly surplus of RM 1 070.

Additional useful ratios (for context)
- Fixed savings as percent of total income = RM 380 / RM 4 850 ≈ 0.0784 → ≈ 7.84% of total monthly income (but it is 10% of salary by requirement).
- Total listed expenses (excluding savings) as percent of income = RM 3 400 / RM 4 850 ≈ 0.701 → ≈ 70.1% of income.
- Total outflows including savings as percent of income = RM 3 780 / RM 4 850 ≈ 0.780 → ≈ 78.0% of income.
- Surplus as percent of income = RM 1 070 / RM 4 850 ≈ 22.1%.

Comments on surplus/deficit and recommendations
- Surplus: Encik Nabil will have a monthly surplus of RM 1 070. No deficit is experienced.
- Recommended use of the surplus (examples):
  - Build / top up emergency fund (target 3–6 months of essential expenses). For example, allocate RM 500/month until target reached.
  - Accelerate mortgage principal payments on housing loans or make extra debt repayments if that reduces interest costs.
  - Increase productive investments (EPF, unit trusts, SRS, or other investments) to meet long‑term goals.
  - Consider reducing discretionary spending (e.g., the RM 400 luxury-restaurant item) if he wants to raise savings rate beyond the fixed 10% of salary.
- Note: His fixed saving meets the stated requirement (RM 380). If the financial goal requires a higher savings rate, he can redirect part of the RM 1 070 surplus toward that goal.

Chapter 10_Q2.png,"(a) Mrs Thong does not spend wisely because her
total monthly savings of RM250 compared to the
income of RM6 000 which is less than 10%.
(b) Mrs Thong will not be able to achieve the
investment goal of RM500 000 with monthly
savings of RM250","Step 1 — Problem understanding
- Find (a) whether Mrs Thong spends her money wisely (qualitative assessment using the provided budget).
- Find (b) whether, with her current spending behaviour, she can buy a property costing RM 500 000 within 6 years.
- Use the provided budget numbers as-is (no assumed extra income or investment returns unless stated).

Step 2 — Mathematical formulation (extract key numbers)
- Monthly income: RM 6 000
- Expense items (monthly): 500, 700, 500, 1 500, 900, 250, 100, 400, 600, 100, 200 (RM)
  - These correspond to: House/apartment loan 500; Car instalment 700; Travel 500; Rental 1 500; Transport fares 900; Utility bills 250; Toll payments 100; Groceries 400; Allowances for parents 600; Savings 100; Insurance 200.
- Total expenses (given): RM 5 750
- Reported monthly savings line: RM 100
- Reported monthly income balance after expenses: RM 250 (i.e., 6 000 − 5 750 = 250)

Step 3 — Solution execution (all calculations shown)

1) Verify total expenses:
- Sum expenses:
  500 + 700 = 1 200
  1 200 + 500 = 1 700
  1 700 + 1 500 = 3 200
  3 200 + 900 = 4 100
  4 100 + 250 = 4 350
  4 350 + 100 = 4 450
  4 450 + 400 = 4 850
  4 850 + 600 = 5 450
  5 450 + 100 = 5 550
  5 550 + 200 = 5 750
- Total expenses = RM 5 750 (matches the table).
- Income balance = 6 000 − 5 750 = RM 250 (matches the table).

2) Current saving capacity under “current spending behaviour”
- The budget’s explicit “Savings” line = RM 100 per month.
- Annual savings at that rate = 100 × 12 = RM 1 200.
- Savings over 6 years at that rate = 1 200 × 6 = RM 7 200.

3) Even if she saved the entire reported income balance (RM 250/month) instead:
- Monthly = RM 250
- Annual = 250 × 12 = RM 3 000
- Over 6 years = 3 000 × 6 = RM 18 000

4) Required savings to buy RM 500 000 property in 6 years (simple target, ignoring interest)
- Needed total = RM 500 000
- Months in 6 years = 6 × 12 = 72
- Required monthly saving = 500 000 ÷ 72 ≈ RM 6 944.44 per month

5) Check feasibility against maximum possible savings from salary
- Maximum possible if she saved every ringgit of salary: 6 000 × 72 = RM 432 000 < RM 500 000
- Therefore, even saving 100% of salary for 6 years would not reach RM 500 000.

Step 4 — Conclusions (answers)

(a) Does Mrs Thong spend her money wisely?
- No, not really. Evidence:
  - Her explicit savings line is only RM 100 per month (RM 1 200 per year), which is very low relative to a RM 6 000 monthly income.
  - She has a small leftover balance RM 250/month (after expenses) — if that is not actively saved or invested it is not building toward goals.
  - Some expense items are large (e.g., rental RM 1 500 and also a house/apartment loan RM 500) which suggests high housing costs; transport fares RM 900 and travel RM 500 are also sizeable discretionary/recurring items to review.
- Recommendation (brief): Increase the savings rate by cutting discretionary spending (travel, transport/tolls), review housing situation, or increase income. Build an emergency fund and plan investments to grow savings.

(b) Will she be able to buy a RM 500 000 property within 6 years with her current spending behaviour?
- No. With current explicit savings of RM 100/month she would accumulate only RM 7 200 in 6 years.
- Even if she saved the entire monthly income balance of RM 250/month, she would only reach RM 18 000 in 6 years.
- Even saving 100% of her salary for 6 years would give RM 432 000, still short of RM 500 000.
- The required monthly saving (ignoring investment returns) to reach RM 500 000 in 6 years is about RM 6 944.44/month, which exceeds her monthly salary of RM 6 000 and is therefore impossible under the current income and spending situation.
- Therefore, under the current spending behaviour and income, she cannot achieve the RM 500 000 goal in 6 years. To make it feasible she would need one or more of:
  - Much higher savings (large cuts to expenses),
  - Additional income (salary/investment returns),
  - Longer time horizon,
  - Use of mortgage financing (buying with a deposit + loan) rather than saving the full purchase price in cash.

Final short answers:
(a) No — savings are very low relative to income; spending should be reviewed. 
(b) No — impossible to save RM 500 000 in 6 years with current income/spending (required ≈ RM 6 944/month; even saving 100% of salary gives only RM 432 000).",correct,4.5945258140563965,6,6,"Full marks (6). The AI answered both parts correctly and in agreement with the ground truth: (a) concluded Mrs Thong does not spend wisely, noting very low savings relative to RM6,000 income; (b) showed she cannot reach RM500,000 in 6 years (computed required ≈ RM6,944.44/month and demonstrated even 100% salary savings for 6 years yields only RM432,000). The response included correct arithmetic, clear reasoning and appropriate conclusions. (Minor note: the AI distinguished the explicit ‘Savings’ line of RM100 and the income balance RM250 but this does not contradict the ground truth conclusion.)",13.765183210372925,, Financial Management,English,gpt-5-mini,9173
