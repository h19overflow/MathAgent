          "calculation": "The general formula given is 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2). Let's check for n=0, 1, 2, 3.\nn=0: 2^(6-0)(\u03c0+2) = 2^6(\u03c0+2) = 64(\u03c0+2) = 64\u03c0 + 128. This does not match P0=32(\u03c0+2). There seems to be a discrepancy in the provided formula. Let's re-examine the radii and perimeters.\nRadii are 32, 16, 8, 4. This can be written as 2^5, 2^4, 2^3, 2^2.\nPerimeters are 32(\u03c0+2), 16(\u03c0+2), 8(\u03c0+2), 4(\u03c0+2). This can be written as 2^5(\u03c0+2), 2^4(\u03c0+2), 2^3(\u03c0+2), 2^2(\u03c0+2).\nSo the nth term (starting with n=0 for the first term) appears to be 2^(5-n)(\u03c0+2).\nLet's verify the provided generalization: 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2). If n starts from 1 instead of 0:\nn=1: 2^(6-1)(\u03c0+2) = 2^5(\u03c0+2) = 32(\u03c0+2). This matches P0.\nn=2: 2^(6-2)(\u03c0+2) = 2^4(\u03c0+2) = 16(\u03c0+2). This matches P1.\nn=3: 2^(6-3)(\u03c0+2) = 2^3(\u03c0+2) = 8(\u03c0+2). This matches P2.\nn=4: 2^(6-4)(\u03c0+2) = 2^2(\u03c0+2) = 4(\u03c0+2). This matches P3.\nTherefore, the generalization is correct if n starts from 1 and refers to the term number in the sequence. However, the problem states n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and implies it corresponds to the perimeters calculated. Let's assume the problem meant the formula is 2^(5-n)(\u03c0+2) for n=0, 1, 2, 3.\nIf we strictly follow the given generalization 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2) and assume 'n' corresponds to the index of the semicircle (0 for the largest, 1 for the next, etc.), then:\nFor n=0, perimeter should be 2^(6-0)(\u03c0+2) = 2^6(\u03c0+2) = 64(\u03c0+2). This does not match our calculation of 32(\u03c0+2).\nLet's re-read the question very carefully. 'show that the generalisation for the perimeters of the four semicircles is 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2); n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...'\nIt's possible that the question implies a different indexing or a typo. Let's assume the formula is correct and see if we can make it fit. If the perimeters are P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2), then:\nP_0 = 2^6(\u03c0+2) = 64(\u03c0+2)\nP_1 = 2^5(\u03c0+2) = 32(\u03c0+2)\nP_2 = 2^4(\u03c0+2) = 16(\u03c0+2)\nP_3 = 2^3(\u03c0+2) = 8(\u03c0+2)\nThis sequence of perimeters corresponds to radii 64, 32, 16, 8. However, the problem states the largest radius is 32.\nThere is a contradiction. Let's proceed with the derived formula based on the given radii: P_n = 2^(5-n)(\u03c0+2) for n=0, 1, 2, 3.\nIf the question *insists* on the formula 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2), and assuming it refers to the perimeters, then there must be a misunderstanding of the problem statement or a typo in the question. However, to 'show that the generalisation is...', we must work with the given formula. Let's assume the question meant that the sequence of radii are 64, 32, 16, 8 for n=0, 1, 2, 3 respectively, and the largest semicircle *in the diagram* is the one with radius 32 (which would be the second term if the sequence started with radius 64). This is confusing.\nLet's assume the question has a typo and the formula should be 2^(5-n)(\u03c0+2) for n=0, 1, 2, 3. In this case, we have already shown this.\nIf we must use 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2), and n=0 corresponds to the largest semicircle with radius 32, then: P_0 = 32(\u03c0+2). The formula gives 2^(6-0)(\u03c0+2) = 64(\u03c0+2). This is a factor of 2 too large.\nLet's try to adjust the formula to fit the data. If the perimeters are P_n = 2^(5-n)(\u03c0+2), and the question provides P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2), it's off by a factor of 2. The only way to reconcile this is if the given formula is intended for a sequence starting with a radius of 64, and the problem statement *then* says the largest semicircle shown has radius 32. This implies the 'largest' in the diagram is not the 'first' in the sequence as defined by the formula.\nLet's re-interpret: Maybe the formula applies to the *sequence* of semicircles, and the 'largest' is just a reference point. If the sequence is P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2), and the radii are decreasing, then for n=0, P_0 = 64(\u03c0+2) and r_0=64. For n=1, P_1 = 32(\u03c0+2) and r_1=32. This matches the largest semicircle in the diagram. So, the formula given is likely correct, and n=1 corresponds to the largest semicircle shown.\nLet's proceed with this assumption: the formula P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2) is correct, and n=1 corresponds to the largest semicircle (radius 32).\nPerimeters calculated: P0 = 32\u03c0 + 64, P1 = 16\u03c0 + 32, P2 = 8\u03c0 + 16, P3 = 4\u03c0 + 8.\nLet's use the provided formula P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2) and see if we can make it match the perimeters we calculated. If we set n=1, we get 2^(6-1)(\u03c0+2) = 2^5(\u03c0+2) = 32(\u03c0+2), which matches P0.\nIf we set n=2, we get 2^(6-2)(\u03c0+2) = 2^4(\u03c0+2) = 16(\u03c0+2), which matches P1.\nIf we set n=3, we get 2^(6-3)(\u03c0+2) = 2^3(\u03c0+2) = 8(\u03c0+2), which matches P2.\nIf we set n=4, we get 2^(6-4)(\u03c0+2) = 2^2(\u03c0+2) = 4(\u03c0+2), which matches P3.\nSo, the generalisation is correct if 'n' in the formula corresponds to the index starting from 1 for the first semicircle, or if the indices in the formula n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4... are shifted. Given the problem states 'n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...' and asks to show the generalisation for the *four* semicircles, it implies that n=0, 1, 2, 3 should correspond to these four semicircles. This leads back to the contradiction.\nLet's assume the problem meant: The perimeters are given by P_k = 2^(5-k)(\u03c0+2) for k=0, 1, 2, 3. And the question wants us to show that P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2) for n=1, 2, 3, 4.\nIf P_n = 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2), then:\nFor n=1, P_1 = 2^(6-1)(\u03c0+2) = 32(\u03c0+2). This is the perimeter of the largest semicircle.\nFor n=2, P_2 = 2^(6-2)(\u03c0+2) = 16(\u03c0+2). This is the perimeter of the second semicircle.\nFor n=3, P_3 = 2^(6-3)(\u03c0+2) = 8(\u03c0+2). This is the perimeter of the third semicircle.\nFor n=4, P_4 = 2^(6-4)(\u03c0+2) = 4(\u03c0+2). This is the perimeter of the fourth semicircle.\nThis interpretation aligns the formula with the calculated perimeters and the visual data, assuming n in the formula starts from 1 for the largest semicircle.\nSo, to 'show that the generalisation... is 2^(6-n)(\u03c0+2); n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...', we must assume that the 'n' in the formula corresponds to a different indexing. If we assume n=1 refers to the first term (largest semicircle), then the formula holds for n=1, 2, 3, 4.\nLet's present the answer for part (b) by showing how the formula works for n=1, 2, 3, 4 corresponding to the four semicircles."
