For part (b), since the data represents time spent on revision, which can have outliers, the interquartile range (IQR) is the most appropriate measure of dispersion as it is less affected by extreme values compared to the range.",

      "reasoning": "The calculations for range, IQR, variance, and standard deviation were directly obtained from the `calculate_ungrouped_statistics` tool.

      "alternative_methods": [
        "For part (a), manual calculation of each statistic would be a longer but valid alternative. For part (b), the range could be considered, but IQR is generally preferred for data that may have outliers."
