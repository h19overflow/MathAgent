      "reasoning": "The calculations directly apply the given formula P(t) = 2^t. For part (a), substituting t=8 yields 2^8 = 256. For part (b), setting P(t) = 2048 and solving for t, we find t=11 since 2^11 = 2048. Both answers are positive integers representing days and cell counts, which makes sense in the context of the problem.",
