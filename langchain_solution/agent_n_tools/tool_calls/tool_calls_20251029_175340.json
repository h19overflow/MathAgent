This involves calculating the mean, range, variance, and standard deviation for each team, assessing the appropriateness of the range as a measure of dispersion, and determining which team has a greater dispersion from the mean.",
      "final_answer": "(a) Team A: Mean = 59.8 kg, Range = 22 kg, Variance = 72.3 kg^2, Standard Deviation = 8.5 kg. Team B: Mean = 63.0 kg, Range = 30 kg, Variance = 131.2 kg^2, Standard Deviation = 11.45 kg.\n(b) The range is not the most appropriate measure of dispersion for this data because it is heavily influenced by the extreme values (minimum and maximum masses) and does not take into account the distribution of the masses in between. A single outlier can significantly affect the range, making it a less robust measure of spread compared to standard deviation or interquartile range.\n(c) Team B has a greater dispersion from the mean. This is evidenced by its larger standard deviation (11.45 kg) compared to Team A (8.5 kg). The larger standard deviation for Team B indicates that its players' masses are, on average, further away from the team's mean mass.",
      "alternative_methods": [
        "For part (a), one could manually calculate each statistic using formulas. For part (b), one could also calculate and compare the Interquartile Range (IQR) to further justify the choice of dispersion measure.",
        "For part (c), one could also compare the variances: Team B (131.2) has a greater variance than Team A (72.3), also indicating greater dispersion."
