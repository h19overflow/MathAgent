      "solution_approach": "First, convert the total number of visitors from base five to base ten. Then, calculate the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total visitors (in base ten) by the number of days in January (31). Finally, convert the average back to base five.",
      "solution_steps": [
        {
          "calculation": "20202_5 = 2*5^4 + 0*5^3 + 2*5^2 + 0*5^1 + 2*5^0",
          "description": "Convert the total number of visitors from base five to base ten.",

        }
      ],
      "reasoning": "The total number of visitors in base five was converted to base ten (1302). The number of days in January is 31. The average was calculated by dividing 1302 by 31, which resulted in 42.0322... This average was then converted back to base five. Since the problem does not specify rounding, we assume that the fractional part of the average is not considered for the final base five representation of the whole number of visitors.",
      "problem_understanding": "The problem asks us to find the average number of daily visitors to Zoo Negara in January, given the total number of visitors in base five and that January has 31 days. The final answer must be in base five.",
      "alternative_methods": [
        "Directly perform division in base five, which is more complex and prone to errors."
      ],
      "final_answer": "The average number of visitors per day in January is 42_5."
