Calculate the area of the square in terms of y: Area_square = side * side. 3. Set up an equation based on the constraint: Area_triangle = Area_square + 39. 4. Solve the quadratic equation for y. 5. Since y represents a length, it must be positive. Select the valid value for y. 6. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle. First, we need to find the length of the equal sides. We can do this by considering a right-angled triangle formed by the height, half of the base, and one of the equal sides. Using the Pythagorean theorem: (equal_side)\u00b2 = height\u00b2 + (base/2)\u00b2. Then, Perimeter_triangle = base + 2 * equal_side. 7. Calculate the perimeter of the square: Perimeter_square = 4 * side. 8. Calculate the difference between the perimeters.",
