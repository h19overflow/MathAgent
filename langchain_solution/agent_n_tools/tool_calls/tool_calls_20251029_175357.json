      "reasoning": "The calculation follows the expected value principle. We determined the probability of each outcome (landing on red/yellow, selecting RM10 voucher from respective box) and combined them to find the overall probability of a customer receiving an RM10 voucher. Multiplying this by the total number of customers gives the expected number of RM10 vouchers required. The constraint about replacement ensures the probabilities remain constant for each customer.",
      "problem_understanding": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of RM10 vouchers Naga Shop needs to prepare for 450 customers. Customers get a chance to spin a lucky wheel. If it lands on red, they choose from Box A; if yellow, they choose from Box B. The number of vouchers of each denomination in each box is given. The key constraint is that selected vouchers are replaced.",
      "final_answer": "The Naga Shop needs to prepare 230 RM10 vouchers.",
      "alternative_methods": [
        "Could also calculate expected number of customers going to Box A and Box B first, then calculate expected RM10 vouchers from each box and sum them up."
