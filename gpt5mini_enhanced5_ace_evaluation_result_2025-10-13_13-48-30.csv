Chapter 1_Q1.png,"No. The pizza with diameter of 30 cm is more
worth it.","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Comparative product-size/pricing diagram (three circles representing pizzas with diameters and prices).
- Extracted data from the diagram:
  - Pizza A: diameter = 15 cm, price = RM12
  - Pizza B: diameter = 23 cm, price = RM25
  - Pizza C: diameter = 30 cm, price = RM35
- Key geometric relation: surface area A of a pizza = π r^2, where r = radius = (diameter)/2.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal: Determine whether the price RMp varies directly (is proportional) to the surface area A of the pizza. If not proportional, state which pizza size is worth buying (i.e., which gives the lowest price per unit area).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Compute areas for each pizza: A = π r^2 with r = diameter/2.
- Compute price per unit area for each pizza: price per cm^2 = price / area.
- If price is directly proportional to area, the ratio (price / area) should be the same for all three pizzas.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Areas:
- Pizza A (15 cm): radius r = 15/2 = 7.5 cm.
  Area_A = π * (7.5)^2 = π * 56.25 = 56.25π cm^2 ≈ 176.7146 cm^2.

- Pizza B (23 cm): radius r = 23/2 = 11.5 cm.
  Area_B = π * (11.5)^2 = π * 132.25 = 132.25π cm^2 ≈ 415.4759 cm^2.

- Pizza C (30 cm): radius r = 30/2 = 15 cm.
  Area_C = π * (15)^2 = π * 225 = 225π cm^2 ≈ 706.8583 cm^2.

2) Price per cm^2:
- Pizza A: 12 / (56.25π) ≈ 12 / 176.7146 ≈ 0.06793 RM/cm^2.
- Pizza B: 25 / (132.25π) ≈ 25 / 415.4759 ≈ 0.06017 RM/cm^2.
- Pizza C: 35 / (225π) ≈ 35 / 706.8583 ≈ 0.04956 RM/cm^2.

3) Check proportionality:
- For direct variation, these three values should be (approximately) equal. They are not:
  - 0.06793, 0.06017, 0.04956 RM/cm^2 (different).
- Alternatively, compare expected price if proportional to area using Pizza A as reference:
  - Area ratios: Area_B / Area_A ≈ 132.25/56.25 ≈ 2.3511 → expected price_B ≈ 12 * 2.3511 ≈ RM28.21 (actual RM25).
  - Area_C / Area_A = 225/56.25 = 4 → expected price_C = 12 * 4 = RM48 (actual RM35).
  - Actual prices differ from proportional predictions, confirming non-proportionality.

Step 5: Final Answer
- No — the price does not vary directly (is not proportional) to the surface area of the pizza, because the price per cm^2 values are different for the three sizes.
- The best value (lowest price per cm^2) is the 30 cm pizza (RM35), at about 0.0496 RM/cm^2. So the 30 cm pizza is worth buying.

Chapter 1_Q2.png,7 cm,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: a word problem with two semicircles illustrating direct variation between area and square of diameter.
- Key features extracted from the diagram and text:
  - Relationship: The area L (cm^2) of a semicircle varies directly as the square of its diameter d (cm): L = k d^2 for some constant k.
  - Given data point 1: L = 3.08 cm^2 when d = 2.8 cm.
  - Given data point 2 (target): L = 19.25 cm^2, find d (cm).
  - Diagram labels: small semicircle shows 2.8 cm and 3.08 cm^2; larger semicircle shows unknown d and 19.25 cm^2.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Find the value of the diameter d (in cm) when the semicircle area L = 19.25 cm^2, given L ∝ d^2 and the provided data.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Use direct variation model: L = k d^2.
- Use the known point to determine k: 3.08 = k (2.8)^2.
- Then solve for d when L = 19.25: 19.25 = k d^2 → d^2 = 19.25 / k → d = sqrt(19.25 / k).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1) Compute k from the known values:
   (2.8)^2 = 7.84.
   k = 3.08 / 7.84.
   Write as fractions to simplify:
     3.08 = 308/100 = 77/25,
     7.84 = 784/100 = 196/25,
     k = (77/25) / (196/25) = 77/196 = divide numerator and denominator by 7 → 11/28.
   So k = 11/28.

2) Use k to find d when L = 19.25:
   d^2 = L / k = 19.25 / (11/28) = 19.25 * (28/11).
   Write 19.25 as a fraction: 19.25 = 77/4.
   d^2 = (77/4) * (28/11) = (77 * 28) / (4 * 11).
   Cancel 11 with 77 → 7 remains: d^2 = (7 * 28) / 4 = 196 / 4 = 49.
   Therefore d = sqrt(49) = 7.

Step 5: Final Answer.
- The diameter d = 7 cm when L = 19.25 cm^2.

Chapter 1_Q3.png,"(a) 154 cm2
(b) The area of the curved surface will
decrease.","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Geometric diagram of a right circular cone showing radius r (base) and slant height s.
- Key features extracted:
  - Curved (lateral) surface area A (cm^2) varies directly as r and s.
  - Functional form implied: A = k r s for some constant k.
  - Given data point: A = 88 cm^2 when r = 3.5 cm and s = 8 cm.
  - Values requested: (a) r = 5 cm, s = 9.8 cm. (b) Qualitative/quantitative change in A if s decreases while r is fixed.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal (a): Calculate A (in cm^2) when r = 5 cm and s = 9.8 cm.
- Goal (b): State how the curved surface area changes if the slant height decreases while the base radius is fixed (give the algebraic expression for the change and the sign).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Since A varies directly as r and s, assume A = k r s.
- Use the given values to find k: 88 = k · 3.5 · 8.
- Then compute A = k · 5 · 9.8 for part (a).
- For part (b), with r fixed, ΔA = k r Δs (so if s decreases, Δs < 0 and ΔA < 0). Using k found, ΔA = (22/7) r Δs.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Find k:
   88 = k · 3.5 · 8
   3.5 · 8 = 28
   k = 88 / 28 = 22 / 7

2. Write formula with k:
   A = (22/7) r s

3. Compute A for r = 5 cm, s = 9.8 cm:
   A = (22/7) · 5 · 9.8
   Note 9.8 = 49/5, so:
   A = (22/7) · 5 · (49/5) = (22/7) · 49 = 22 · 7 = 154
   So A = 154 cm^2.

4. Change in area when s decreases and r fixed:
   - General change: ΔA = k r Δs = (22/7) r Δs.
   - Because Δs < 0 when s decreases, ΔA is negative: the curved surface area decreases.
   - For a specific decrease of Δs = −1 cm, ΔA = (22/7) r (−1) = −(22/7) r cm^2 (example).

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) A = 154 cm^2.
- (b) With r fixed, the curved surface area changes by ΔA = (22/7) r Δs. If s decreases (Δs < 0) then ΔA < 0, so the curved surface area decreases. (Units: cm^2)

(b) the number of glasses of drink P = 2,
the number of glasses of drink Q = 1","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: A data table (nutrient table) giving protein and calories per glass for two drinks.
- Key features extracted directly from the table:
  - Drink P: protein = 6 g per glass, calories = 95 kcal per glass.
  - Drink Q: protein = 4 g per glass, calories = 110 kcal per glass.
  - Diet targets: total protein = 16 g, total calories = 300 kcal per day.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goals:
  (a) Form two linear equations using the given information.
  (b) Calculate the number of glasses of drink P and drink Q Syahirah needs per day, using the matrix method. The required final answer should be numbers of glasses (units: glasses).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- Let x = number of glasses of Drink P, y = number of glasses of Drink Q.
- From protein: 6x + 4y = 16.
- From calories: 95x + 110y = 300.
- Matrix form: A [x y]^T = b where
  A = [[6, 4],
       [95,110]],
  b = [16, 300]^T.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation (matrix method).
1. Compute determinant of A:
   det(A) = 6*110 - 4*95 = 660 - 380 = 280.

2. Compute inverse of A using formula for 2x2 matrix:
   A^-1 = (1/det) * [[110, -4],
                     [-95,  6]]
        = (1/280) * [[110, -4],
                     [-95,  6]].

3. Multiply A^-1 by b to get [x y]^T:
   [x y]^T = (1/280) * [[110, -4], [-95, 6]] * [16, 300]^T.

   Compute the vector product numerator:
   - First component numerator = 110*16 + (-4)*300 = 1760 - 1200 = 560.
     So x = 560 / 280 = 2.

   - Second component numerator = (-95)*16 + 6*300 = -1520 + 1800 = 280.
     So y = 280 / 280 = 1.

4. Check solutions in original equations:
   - Protein: 6(2) + 4(1) = 12 + 4 = 16 (OK).
   - Calories: 95(2) + 110(1) = 190 + 110 = 300 (OK).

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) Two linear equations:
  6x + 4y = 16
  95x + 110y = 300
- (b) Number of glasses per day:
  x = 2 glasses of Drink P, y = 1 glass of Drink Q.

            = 66

- Compute overall mark for Computer Science (third row):

4. Multiply A^{-1} by y:
   x = A^{-1} y = (1/2) * [[3, -2], [-5, 4]] * [26, 35]^T.

   Compute the product inside:
   - First component (numerator for p): 3*26 + (-2)*35 = 78 - 70 = 8.
   - Second component (numerator for b): (-5)*26 + 4*35 = -130 + 140 = 10.

Chapter 3_Q2.png,"(a) RM50.38
(b) (i) RM796
(ii) RM244","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: A small data table (rates table) showing premium rates per RM1,000 face value.
- Extracted key features from the table:
  - Rates are for healthy, non-smoking men, and are given per RM1,000 face value (annual rates).
  - For a 35-year-old:
    - 5-year term: RM 5.24 (per RM1,000 per year)
    - Yearly Renewable Term (YRT): RM 4.03 (per RM1,000 per year)
  - For a 45-year-old:
    - 5-year term: RM 7.96 (per RM1,000 per year)
    - Yearly Renewable Term (YRT): RM 5.52 (per RM1,000 per year)
- Labeled persons and face values in the question:
  - Rizqi: 35 years old, wants YRT, face value RM150,000.
  - Vincent: 45 years old, face value RM100,000; compare 5-year term and YRT.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Compute Rizqi’s monthly premium for a yearly renewable term plan of RM150,000 (he is 35).
- (b)(i) Compute Vincent’s annual premium for a 5-year term with face value RM100,000 (he is 45).
- (b)(ii) Compute the difference in Vincent’s annual premium if he buys a YRT instead of the 5-year term (both for RM100,000).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- General formula: Annual premium = (Face value / RM1,000) × (rate per RM1,000).
- Monthly premium = Annual premium / 12.
- Apply appropriate rate from the table for each person and plan.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation

(a) Rizqi (35 years old), YRT, face value RM150,000:
- Number of RM1,000 units = 150,000 / 1,000 = 150.
- YRT rate for 35-year-old = RM 4.03 per RM1,000 per year.
- Annual premium = 150 × 4.03 = 150×4 + 150×0.03 = 600 + 4.50 = RM 604.50 per year.
- Monthly premium = 604.50 / 12 = 50.375 = RM 50.38 (to the nearest cent).

(b)(i) Vincent (45 years old), 5-year term, face value RM100,000:
- Number of RM1,000 units = 100,000 / 1,000 = 100.
- 5-year term rate for 45-year-old = RM 7.96 per RM1,000 per year.
- Annual premium = 100 × 7.96 = RM 796.00 per year.

(b)(ii) Vincent (45 years old), YRT for RM100,000 and difference:
- YRT rate for 45-year-old = RM 5.52 per RM1,000 per year.
- Annual YRT premium = 100 × 5.52 = RM 552.00 per year.
- Difference (5-year term minus YRT) = 796.00 − 552.00 = RM 244.00 per year.
- Interpretation: The 5-year term costs RM 244.00 more per year than the YRT for Vincent.

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) Rizqi’s monthly premium = RM 50.38 (monthly), which corresponds to an annual premium of RM 604.50.
- (b)(i) Vincent’s annual premium for the 5-year term = RM 796.00 per year.
- (b)(ii) Vincent’s annual premium for YRT = RM 552.00 per year; the 5-year term is RM 244.00 per year more expensive than the YRT.

  - Private car shown with engine capacity 1 860 cc.
  - Motorcycle Road Tax Rate table entries:
    - 150 cc and below: Free

    - 201 cc – 250 cc: RM 50.00
  - Private Car Road Tax Rate table entries (relevant rows):
    - 1 401 cc – 1 600 cc: RM 90.00
    - 1 601 cc – 1 800 cc: RM 200.00 + RM 0.40 per cc exceeding 1 600 cc
    - 1 801 cc – 2 000 cc: RM 280.00 + RM 0.50 per cc exceeding 1 800 cc
    - 2 001 cc – 2 500 cc: RM 380.00 + RM 1.00 per cc exceeding 2 000 cc
- Labeled points from the diagram to be used: motorcycle = 220 cc, car = 1 860 cc.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Calculate the road tax (in RM) for both the motorcycle (220 cc) and the private car (1 860 cc) based on the provided rate table.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Motorcycle: Identify which motorcycle bracket 220 cc falls into, then take the corresponding flat/base rate.
  - Since 220 cc is in 201–250 cc bracket, motorcycle tax = RM 50.00.
- Private car: Identify the car bracket for 1 860 cc and apply base rate plus progressive rate for cc exceeding the bracket threshold.
  - 1 860 cc falls in the 1 801–2 000 cc bracket.
  - Formula: car tax = base rate (RM 280.00) + (progressive rate RM 0.50) × (cc exceeding 1 800 cc).
  - Excess cc = 1 860 − 1 800.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
- Motorcycle:
  1. Determine bracket: 220 cc ∈ [201, 250] cc.
  2. Read rate: bracket rate = RM 50.00.
  3. Motorcycle road tax = RM 50.00.

- Private car:
  1. Determine bracket: 1 860 cc ∈ [1 801, 2 000] cc.
  2. Base rate = RM 280.00.
  3. Excess over 1 800 cc = 1 860 − 1 800 = 60 cc.
  4. Progressive charge = 60 cc × RM 0.50/cc = RM 30.00.
  5. Total car road tax = base + progressive = RM 280.00 + RM 30.00 = RM 310.00.

Step 5: Final Answer
- Motorcycle (220 cc) road tax = RM 50.00.
- Private car (1 860 cc) road tax = RM 310.00.

Chapter 4_Q2.png,"Mr Subra had to pay RM712 and his wife had
to pay RM68. Hence, the total income tax for
Mr Subra and his wife was RM780.","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Diagram type: A tabular summary of income and allowable personal tax reliefs (a financial relief table).
- Key features extracted from the table:
  - Gross annual salary of Encik Suhaimi in 2020: RM85,700.
  - His wife has no income.
  - Claimed relief items (with any stated limits):
    - Individual relief: RM9,000 (no cap stated beyond the amount).
    - Life insurance and EPF: claimed RM7,760, but limited to RM7,000 → allowed RM7,000.
    - Lifestyle: claimed RM2,000, limited to RM2,500 → allowed RM2,000.
    - Spouse relief (for spouse with no income): RM4,000 → allowed RM4,000.
    - Medical treatment expenses for parents: claimed RM1,500, limited to RM5,000 → allowed RM1,500.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Calculate the total income tax for Encik Suhaimi and his wife under joint tax assessment (i.e., compute tax on combined chargeable income). Since the wife has no income, this effectively means compute tax on Encik Suhaimi’s chargeable income after allowable reliefs.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Taxable/chargeable income = Gross income − Total allowable reliefs.
- Total allowable reliefs = sum of each allowed relief (respecting stated caps).
- Use Malaysian resident individual income tax rates for YA2020 (progressive rates used here):
  - 0% on first RM5,000
  - 1% on next RM15,000 (RM5,001–RM20,000)
  - 3% on next RM15,000 (RM20,001–RM35,000)
  - 8% on next RM15,000 (RM35,001–RM50,000)
  - 14% on next RM20,000 (RM50,001–RM70,000)
  - (Higher brackets are irrelevant here because chargeable income will be below RM70,000)
- Compute tax by applying these marginal rates to the chargeable income.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Determine allowed reliefs:
   - Individual: RM9,000
   - Life insurance & EPF: allowed = RM7,000 (claimed RM7,760 but capped at RM7,000)
   - Lifestyle: allowed = RM2,000 (claimed RM2,000, cap RM2,500)
   - Spouse relief: RM4,000
   - Medical for parents: RM1,500 (claimed RM1,500, cap RM5,000)
2) Total allowable reliefs:
   - Total reliefs = 9,000 + 7,000 + 2,000 + 4,000 + 1,500
   - Total reliefs = RM23,500
3) Chargeable income:
   - Chargeable income = Gross income − Total reliefs
   - Chargeable income = 85,700 − 23,500 = RM62,200
4) Compute tax on RM62,200 using marginal rates:
   - First RM5,000 at 0% → tax = RM0
   - Next RM15,000 (RM5,001–RM20,000) at 1% → tax = 15,000 × 1% = RM150
   - Next RM15,000 (RM20,001–RM35,000) at 3% → tax = 15,000 × 3% = RM450
   - Next RM15,000 (RM35,001–RM50,000) at 8% → tax = 15,000 × 8% = RM1,200
   - Remaining income = RM62,200 − RM50,000 = RM12,200 taxed at 14% → tax = 12,200 × 14% = RM1,708.00
   - Total tax = 0 + 150 + 450 + 1,200 + 1,708 = RM3,508.00
5) Round as appropriate to nearest ringgit: RM3,508.

Step 5: Final Answer
- Under joint assessment (wife has no income), the total income tax payable for Encik Suhaimi and his wife for YA2020 is RM3,508.

- Type of diagram: Concentric circles (an annulus).
- Key features extracted from the diagram and text:
  - Two circles share the same centre O.
  - Radius of the small circle r = 3 cm.
  - The coloured region is the annulus between the large and small circle.
  - Area of the coloured region = 47.25π cm².
  - The large circle is the image of the small circle under an enlargement with centre O; let the linear scale factor be k (so large radius R = k·r).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal: Calculate the scale factor k of the enlargement (the linear multiplier from the small circle to the large circle).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Area of large circle = πR² = π(k·r)² = π r² k².
- Area of small circle = π r².
- Area of annulus (coloured region) = π r² k² − π r² = π r² (k² − 1).
- Given π r² (k² − 1) = 47.25π. Cancel π to get r² (k² − 1) = 47.25.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Substitute r = 3 cm: r² = 9.
2. 9 (k² − 1) = 47.25.
3. Divide both sides by 9: k² − 1 = 47.25 / 9 = 5.25.
4. k² = 5.25 + 1 = 6.25.
5. k = sqrt(6.25) = 2.5 (take positive root because scale factor is positive).
6. (Check) Large radius R = k·r = 2.5·3 = 7.5 cm. Area large = π·7.5² = 56.25π. Area small = 9π. Difference = 56.25π − 9π = 47.25π (matches given).

Chapter 5_Q2.png,1 215 cm,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Pinhole camera / similar-triangles geometry (projection).
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - The distance from the pinhole to the image (the screen inside the camera) is 15 cm (labeled on the box).
  - The scale factor of the image is given as -1/80. (Negative indicates the image is inverted; magnitude 1/80 is the linear size ratio.)
  - The tree is the object; its image is formed inside the camera by rays through the pinhole.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Goal: Find the horizontal distance, in centimetres, between the tree (object) and its image (on the screen inside the camera).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- For a pinhole camera (similar triangles), the linear scale factor (image size / object size) equals image distance / object distance, i.e.
  scale = (distance from pinhole to image) / (distance from pinhole to object).
- Given scale = -1/80, use magnitude 1/80 for distances:
  1/80 = (image distance) / (object distance).
- Known: image distance = 15 cm. Let object distance = D (distance from pinhole to tree).
  So 1/80 = 15 / D.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Solve for D:
   1/80 = 15 / D
   Multiply both sides by D: D/80 = 15
   Multiply both sides by 80: D = 15 * 80
   D = 1200 cm.

2) Distance between the tree and its image:
   The tree is D = 1200 cm in front of the pinhole; the image is 15 cm on the other side of the pinhole.

- Type of diagram: Trapezium (right trapezoid) geometry diagram.
- Extracted key features from the diagram:
  - Top base length = 80 m.
  - Bottom base length = 320 m.
  - Height (distance between the parallel bases, i.e. the left vertical side) = 200 m.
  - Left side is vertical (right angles shown at top-left and bottom-left).
  - Right side is slanted; its horizontal projection equals the difference between the bases = 320 − 80 = 240 m.
  - The land is divided into three congruent sections (so total area is divided equally into three).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Two goals:
  (a) Find the perimeter (in metres) of the trapezium-shaped land.
  (b) Find the area (in m^2) of each of the three congruent sections.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- Perimeter P = top base + bottom base + left side + right side.
- Left side = height = 200 m.
- Right side length L_right is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with vertical leg 200 m and horizontal leg 240 m:
  L_right = sqrt(200^2 + 240^2).
- Area of the trapezium A_total = (1/2) * (sum of parallel bases) * height = (1/2) * (80 + 320) * 200.
- Area of each congruent section = A_total / 3.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1) Compute right side length:
   - 200^2 = 40,000
   - 240^2 = 57,600
   - Sum = 97,600
   - L_right = sqrt(97,600) = sqrt(16 * 6,100) = 4 * sqrt(6,100) = 40 * sqrt(61).
   - Decimal: sqrt(61) ≈ 7.8102497, so L_right ≈ 40 * 7.8102497 ≈ 312.409988 ≈ 312.41 m.

2) Perimeter:
   - P = 80 + 320 + 200 + L_right = 600 + 40 * sqrt(61).
   - Decimal: P ≈ 600 + 312.409988 ≈ 912.409988 ≈ 912.41 m.

3) Total area:
   - A_total = (1/2) * (80 + 320) * 200 = (1/2) * 400 * 200 = 200 * 200 = 40,000 m^2.

4) Area of each congruent section:
   - A_section = A_total / 3 = 40,000 / 3 ≈ 13,333.333... m^2.

- Type of diagram: Right triangle formed by a piece of wood leaning against a vertical wall (a right-triangle geometry diagram).
- Key features extracted:
  - Hypotenuse (length of wood) = 8 m.
  - Horizontal distance from wall to base (adjacent side to angle θ) = 6 m.
  - Angle θ is at the base between the wood (hypotenuse) and the horizontal ground.
  - Vertical side (opposite to θ) is the height where the wood touches the wall (not labeled numerically on the diagram).

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- Goal: Calculate the value of sin θ (the sine of the angle between the wood and the horizontal).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- For the right triangle, sin θ = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse).
- Adjacent side = 6 m, hypotenuse = 8 m. The opposite side can be found by the Pythagorean theorem:
  opposite = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 − adjacent^2).
- Alternatively use cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse and the identity sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
Method A (Pythagoras):
1. Compute opposite side:
   opposite = sqrt(8^2 − 6^2) = sqrt(64 − 36) = sqrt(28) = 2·sqrt(7).
2. Then sin θ = opposite / hypotenuse = (2·sqrt(7)) / 8 = sqrt(7) / 4.

Method B (using cosine and identity):
1. cos θ = adjacent / hypotenuse = 6 / 8 = 3 / 4.
2. sin^2 θ = 1 − cos^2 θ = 1 − (3/4)^2 = 1 − 9/16 = 7/16.
3. sin θ = sqrt(7/16) = sqrt(7) / 4 (positive since θ is acute).

Numeric approximation (optional): sqrt(7)/4 ≈ 0.6614378.

Step 5: Final Answer.
- sin θ = sqrt(7) / 4 ≈ 0.6614. (Sine is dimensionless — no units.)

Verification (strategy used: [ID:07ed626e-a9d0-43ce-bc4b-352bac05ab22]):
- The final answer is given in a simplified exact form and a decimal approximation; sin is unitless, so the format matches the question.

Evaluation of strategies used:

Chapter 6_Q2.png,(a) y = sin x (b) 30°,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: Graph of a trigonometric function on 0° ≤ x ≤ 360°.
- Key features extracted from the graph:
  - The curve crosses the x-axis at x = 0°, x = 180°, and x = 360° (zeros at 0°, 180°, 360°).
  - Maximum value y = 1 at x = 90°.
  - Minimum value y = −1 at x = 270°.
  - The curve is symmetric and has amplitude 1 and midpoint y = 0 (no vertical shift).
  - A point on the curve is labeled (m, 0.5) and lies between x = 0° and x = 90°.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- (a) Write the trigonometric function shown.
- (b) State the value of m (the x-coordinate where y = 0.5 between 0° and 90°).

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- General form: y = A sin(Bx + C) + D.
- From Step 1: amplitude A = 1, vertical shift D = 0, period = 360° ⇒ B = 1 (since period = 360°/B).
- Zeros at 0°, 180°, 360° and max at 90° match y = sin x. Thus candidate function: y = sin x.
- For m: solve sin(m) = 0.5 with 0° ≤ m ≤ 90°.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
1. Identify function:
   - sin x has zeros at 0°, 180°, 360°, maximum 1 at 90°, minimum −1 at 270°. This matches the graph, so
   - y = sin x.
2. Solve sin(m) = 0.5 for 0° ≤ m ≤ 90°:
   - Reference value: sin 30° = 1/2.
   - Therefore m = 30° (the other solution in [0°,360°] would be 150°, but the plotted point is between 0° and 90°).

Step 5: Final Answer.
- (a) y = sin x
- (b) m = 30°

Strategy evaluation:
- Helpful strategies: recognizing zeros and extrema to identify the basic sine function; using known unit-circle reference values (sin 30° = 1/2) to find m.
- Potentially harmful/ambiguous considerations: without noting the location of the labeled point relative to 0°–90°, one might incorrectly pick the other solution m = 150°. Careful reading of the graph removes that ambiguity.

Chapter 6_Q3.png,11.5 m,"Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: geometric / coordinate diagram (circle with labelled points and a vertical boundary).
- Extracted features:
  - Band members form a circle with diameter 10 m → radius r = 5 m.
  - Circle centre O is at (0,0).
  - Original position is labelled (5, 0) (the eastmost point of the circle).
  - The field boundary is a vertical line to the right of the circle. The original position is 9 m from that boundary, so the boundary has x-coordinate x_boundary = 5 + 9 = 14.
  - New position lies on the same circle at an angle of 300° (standard polar angle measured from positive x-axis) → new position coordinates can be written (x_new, y_new) = (r cos 300°, r sin 300°).
  - The question asks for the shortest distance from the new position to the field boundary.

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- Explicit goal: Find the shortest distance (in metres) from the new position on the circle to the vertical field boundary.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- New position coordinates:
  x_new = r cos(300°), y_new = r sin(300°), with r = 5.
- Field boundary is vertical line x = x_boundary = 14.
- Shortest distance from a point (x_new, y_new) to a vertical line x = x_boundary is the horizontal (perpendicular) distance |x_boundary − x_new|.
- So required distance d = x_boundary − x_new (x_new < x_boundary here), with x_new = 5 cos 300°.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Compute cos 300° and sin 300°:
   - cos 300° = cos(360° − 60°) = cos 60° = 1/2.
   - sin 300° = sin(360° − 60°) = −sin 60° = −√3/2 (not needed for the distance but shown for completeness).
2. Compute x_new:
   - x_new = r cos 300° = 5 × (1/2) = 2.5 m.
3. Compute x_boundary:
   - x_boundary = 14 m (from Step 1).
4. Compute shortest distance d:
   - d = x_boundary − x_new = 14 − 2.5 = 11.5 m.

Step 5: Final Answer
- The shortest distance you would walk from your new position to the field boundary is 11.5 m.

(b) Wildan’s performance is better than
Rozaidy’s because the values of the
median and the third quartile are higher
than Rozaidy’s.","Step 1 — Diagram Deconstruction
- Type of diagram: Ogive (cumulative frequency graph) showing distances of shot-put throws for two athletes (Rozaidy — pink curve, Wildan — dark/blue curve).
- Axes and labels:
  - Horizontal axis: Distance (m) with marked upper class boundaries 10.45, 12.45, 14.45, 16.45, 18.45, 20.45.
  - Vertical axis: Cumulative frequency from 0 up to 20 (top of the graph).
- Key features extracted from the graph (read directly / by interpolation):
  - Total number of throws for each athlete: 20 (cumulative frequency reaches 20 for each curve).
  - We will need the cumulative frequency (CF) at distance x = 15.45 m (this lies halfway between 14.45 and 16.45). For each athlete we read (and, where necessary, linearly interpolate) the CF at 15.45 from the ogive.
  - For part (b) we need the median (CF = 10) and the third quartile Q3 (CF = 15): read off the corresponding distances on each curve.

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
(a) For each athlete (Rozaidy and Wildan) calculate the percentage of throws that exceed 15.45 m.
(b) Using the median and the third quartile (Q3) for each athlete, state which athlete performed better in the training session.

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
- Let CF_R(15.45) be Rozaidy’s cumulative frequency at 15.45 m, CF_W(15.45) be Wildan’s.
- Number of throws that exceed 15.45 m = total throws − cumulative frequency at 15.45.
  - For each athlete: count_exceed = 20 − CF(15.45).
- Percentage exceeding = (count_exceed / 20) × 100%.
- Median: distance at CF = 10. Q3: distance at CF = 15. Read these from the ogive for each athlete.

Step 4 — Step-by-step calculation (reading from graph and interpolating)
Important note: the ogive is read from a printed graph; exact values must be read visually and are therefore approximate. I show the interpolation method and give the values I obtain from reading this image.

(a) Percentage of throws exceeding 15.45 m
- Read CF at the nearby class boundaries and interpolate to 15.45 (midway between 14.45 and 16.45).

  Rozaidy:
  - CF at 14.45 (from the pink curve) ≈ 6 (approximate read-off).
  - CF at 16.45 (from the pink curve) ≈ 17 (approximate read-off).
  - Interpolate to 15.45 (halfway): CF_R(15.45) ≈ (6 + 17)/2 = 11.5.
  - Number exceeding = 20 − 11.5 = 8.5 throws.
  - Percentage exceeding ≈ (8.5 / 20) × 100% = 42.5% ≈ 43%.

  Wildan:
  - CF at 14.45 (from the blue curve) ≈ 5 (approximate read-off).
  - CF at 16.45 (from the blue curve) ≈ 19 (approximate read-off).
  - Interpolate to 15.45: CF_W(15.45) ≈ (5 + 19)/2 = 12.0.
  - Number exceeding = 20 − 12.0 = 8.0 throws.
  - Percentage exceeding ≈ (8.0 / 20) × 100% = 40%.

  Rounded answers for (a):
  - Rozaidy: ≈ 42.5% (≈ 43%) of throws exceed 15.45 m.
  - Wildan: ≈ 40% of throws exceed 15.45 m.

(b) Median (CF = 10) and third quartile Q3 (CF = 15)
- Read the distance corresponding to CF = 10 and CF = 15 on each athlete’s curve (values are approximate):

  Rozaidy:
  - Median (CF = 10) at distance ≈ 15.2 m (visual interpolation).
  - Q3 (CF = 15) at distance ≈ 16.4 m.

  Wildan:
  - Median (CF = 10) at distance ≈ 15.6 m.
  - Q3 (CF = 15) at distance ≈ 17.0 m.

- Interpretation:
  - Wildan has the larger median (≈ 15.6 m vs ≈ 15.2 m) and the larger third quartile (≈ 17.0 m vs ≈ 16.4 m). These show that Wildan’s typical and upper-25%-performance distances are greater than Rozaidy’s.

Step 5 — Final Answer
(a) Percentage of throws exceeding 15.45 m (approximate, read from the ogive):
- Rozaidy: ≈ 42.5% (≈ 43%)
- Wildan: ≈ 40%

(b) Based on the median and the third quartile:
- Wildan performs better (higher median ≈ 15.6 m and higher Q3 ≈ 17.0 m compared with Rozaidy’s median ≈ 15.2 m and Q3 ≈ 16.4 m).

Strategy verification / units note:
- I verified the percentages are given as percentages and distances are in metres [ID:55724365-be92-4b0c-b532-007ded517c1f].

Evaluation of strategies used
- Helpful strategies:
  - Diagram deconstruction: identifying the ogive type, total frequency, and target CF values (0, 10, 15, 20) made it straightforward to set up interpolation and the percentage calculation.
  - Linear interpolation between class-boundary CFs to estimate CF at 15.45: appropriate for reading values from a smooth ogive when the exact data points are not tabulated.
  - Using median (CF = 10) and Q3 (CF = 15) as robust summary measures for part (b): directly answers which athlete’s performance is better in central tendency and upper performance.

- Harmful / limiting factors:
  - Reliance on a visual read-off from the provided image introduces approximation error. The single image resolution and small size limit precision; exact values would require the underlying frequency table.
  - Assuming linear interpolation between the plotted points is an approximation — the true cumulative may not be exactly linear between the plotted class boundaries.

If you want, I can (a) re-do the interpolation with different more-precise read-offs if you can provide a higher-resolution image or the original data, or (b) present the same solution with tighter rounding or alternative plausible read-off choices.",wrong,4.596593379974365,4,6,"Total marks available = 6.

However the numerical CF readings/interpolations it reported (leading to Rozaidy ≈ 42.5% and Wildan 40%) do not match the ground-truth percentages (25% and 45%) and are substantially incorrect, so award 2/4 for correct method but wrong final values.

- Type of diagram: Histogram (grouped frequency histogram of blood glucose readings).
- Class intervals and frequencies (extracted from the bars and tick marks at 2.95, 3.95, 4.95, 5.95, 6.95, 7.95, 8.95):
  - 2.95–3.95 : frequency f1 = 5
  - 3.95–4.95 : f2 = 10
  - 4.95–5.95 : f3 = 20
  - 5.95–6.95 : f4 = 25

  - 7.95–8.95 : f6 = 30
  - Total N = 5+10+20+25+40+30 = 130
- Class midpoints (used for grouped calculations):
  - m1 = 3.45, m2 = 4.45, m3 = 5.45, m4 = 6.45, m5 = 7.45, m6 = 8.45
- Frequencies at the heights (y-axis units are counts).

Step 2: Question Interpretation
- (a) Decide whether the distribution is symmetrical; give reason.
- (b) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the blood glucose readings (use the histogram data).
- (c) Compare the standard deviation for readings between 6.0 mmol/L and 8.9 mmol/L with the standard deviation found in (b) and justify.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- For grouped data:
  - Mean = (Σ f_i * m_i) / N
  - Variance (population-style, using class midpoints) = (Σ f_i * m_i^2)/N − (Mean)^2
  - Standard deviation = sqrt(Variance)
- For part (c) consider the classes that fall in the range 6.0–8.9 mmol/L. Using the histogram classes, we include the full classes:
  - 5.95–6.95 (midpoint 6.45, f4 = 25), 6.95–7.95 (m5 = 7.45, f5 = 40), 7.95–8.95 (m6 = 8.45, f6 = 30)
  - Subset total N_sub = 25+40+30 = 95
  - Compute Mean_sub and SD_sub using the same grouped formulas on these classes (note: this is an approximation because 6.0 cuts into the 5.95–6.95 class; standard grouped-data practice is to include the whole class).

- (Σ f_i m_i^2)/N = 6253.825 / 130 = 48.1063461538
- Variance = 48.1063461538 − (6.79615384615)^2

- Rounded: mean_sub ≈ 7.50 mmol/L, SD_sub ≈ 0.79 mmol/L.

Step 5: Final Answer
- (a) The distribution is not symmetrical. It is skewed to the left (negatively skewed) because most readings are concentrated at higher glucose values with a tail toward the lower readings.
- (b) Using grouped-data midpoints, the mean blood glucose ≈ 6.80 mmol/L and the standard deviation ≈ 1.39 mmol/L.
- (c) For readings between 6.0 and 8.9 mmol/L (approximated by the classes 5.95–6.95, 6.95–7.95, 7.95–8.95), mean ≈ 7.50 mmol/L and standard deviation ≈ 0.79 mmol/L. The standard deviation for this restricted range is substantially smaller than the overall standard deviation (0.79 vs 1.39 mmol/L) because restricting to the central portion of the data reduces spread and excludes the lower-value classes that increase overall variability.

Notes on approximation: calculations use class midpoints and include whole classes that intersect the 6.0 mmol/L lower limit (standard grouped-data approximation). This gives an estimate appropriate for histogram-based grouped calculations.

- Harmful / Limiting: No other external strategies were used; a possible limitation is the grouped-data approximation when the specified 6.0 mmol/L cutoff cuts a class boundary (we approximated by including the whole class), which slightly affects the subset mean and SD.

- Before medicine: mean = 151.6 mmHg, standard deviation ≈ 15.54 mmHg.
- After medicine: mean = 142.0 mmHg, standard deviation ≈ 13.69 mmHg.
- Interpretation / justification: The average systolic blood pressure of the group decreased by 151.6 − 142.0 = 9.6 mmHg after taking the medicine, and the spread (standard deviation) also decreased slightly. Based on these summary statistics, the medicine appears effective in lowering the group’s systolic blood pressure (mean reduction ≈ 9.6 mmHg). (No formal hypothesis test was requested; the conclusion is based on the observed reduction in mean.)

- Type of diagram: Parabolic arc representing the main cable of a suspension bridge (a graph of a quadratic function).
- Key features extracted from the diagram:
  - Horizontal span between tower tops (distance between towers) = 600 m.
  - The deck level is the reference (y measured above the deck).
  - Tower top height above deck = 35 m (so the cable height at the towers is 35 m).
  - The cable’s lowest point (vertex of the parabola) is 5 m above the deck (shortest distance to deck = 5 m), located at midspan (center of the 600 m span).
  - Suspenders are placed every 20 m along the deck.

Step 2 — Question Interpretation
- (a) Determine the function (equation) that represents the arc of the main cable (a parabola).
- (b) If the suspenders are 20 m apart, determine the number of suspender cables needed on both sides of the bridge (i.e., total number for the whole 600 m span).

Step 3 — Mathematical Formulation
- Model the main cable as a parabola with vertex at the midpoint (x = 0) and y measured in meters above the deck.
- Let the parabola be y = a x^2 + k. Vertex at (0,5) gives k = 5, so y = a x^2 + 5.
- The tower positions are at x = ±300 m (half of 600 m). At x = 300, y = 35 (tower top).
- Use point (300,35) to solve for a: 35 = a(300)^2 + 5.
- For suspenders: half-span = 300 m. If suspenders are spaced every 20 m, the number per side = (300 m) / (20 m). Total = twice that.

Step 4 — Step-by-Step Calculation
(a) Find a and the parabola:
- Use 35 = a(300)^2 + 5.
- 35 − 5 = a(90000) → 30 = 90000 a.
- a = 30 / 90000 = 1 / 3000.
- Therefore the parabola is y = (1/3000) x^2 + 5 (y in meters, x in meters measured from midspan).

(b) Number of suspenders:
- Half-span = 600 / 2 = 300 m.
- Number of suspenders per side = 300 / 20 = 15.
- Total on both sides = 2 × 15 = 30 suspenders.

(Note on interpretation: The calculation above assumes suspenders are placed along each half-span every 20 m starting from the tower side to the midspan so that there are 15 on each side. If instead suspenders are placed across the entire 600 m span at 20 m intervals starting at one end and including both endpoints, one would count 600/20 + 1 = 31 attachment points; design conventions determine whether you count endpoints/center separately. The answer given follows the common interpretation of 15 per side → 30 total.)

Step 5 — Final Answer
- (a) The main cable is modeled by the parabola y = (1/3000) x^2 + 5, where x is meters from midspan and y is meters above the deck.
- (b) With suspenders 20 m apart, there are 15 suspenders on each side of the bridge and 30 suspenders in total (note the endpoint-counting caveat explained above).

Strategy evaluation (after solution)
- Helpful strategies:
  - Using a vertex-form quadratic model with symmetry about midspan made the modeling straightforward.
  - Using the given tower height and half-span to solve for the parabola coefficient gave a simple direct computation.
  - [ID:20e777b7-c3b4-4541-8b3e-19607bcafcd8] Verifying units and that the final answers are stated with units (meters, counts) was helpful to ensure the answers match the question’s format and units.
- Potentially harmful/ambiguous aspects:
  - The wording about how to count suspenders (whether to include center or endpoints) is ambiguous; assuming one interpretation without stating the assumption could lead to a different numeric answer. I made the explicit assumption (15 per side → 30 total) and noted the alternate counting (31) for clarity.",wrong,5.697497606277466,3,6,"Total available = 6 marks (per instruction: give full mark only if answer matches ground truth).

B – exponential model
C – linear model
(b) Exponential model. Temperature will not

Temperature will not drop below 0°C as
shown in the linear model.","Step 1: Diagram Deconstruction.
- Type of diagram: Graph of temperature versus time showing three candidate models (a linear, a quadratic, and an exponential model) together with a table of measured data.
- Given data points extracted from the table:
  - t = 0 s, T = 200 °C
  - t = 40 s, T = 140 °C
  - t = 80 s, T = 100 °C
  - t = 120 s, T = 75 °C
- Visual features of the three curves (labeled A, B, C in the diagram):
  - Curve C: a straight line (constant slope), decreasing through the data — so it is the linear candidate.
  - Curve A: curved, reaches a minimum and then rises for larger t (parabola-like opening upward) — so it is the quadratic candidate.
  - Curve B: monotonically decreasing and leveling off toward a horizontal asymptote — so it is the exponential candidate.
- Extracted/derived simple equations where appropriate:
  - Linear (using points t=0 and t=120): slope m = (75 − 200)/(120 − 0) = −125/120 = −25/24 ≈ −1.0416667 °C/s. Linear model: T_lin(t) = 200 − (25/24) t.
  - Quadratic fit through (0,200), (80,100), (120,75):
    - Let T_q(t) = a t^2 + b t + c. From t=0: c = 200.
    - From t=80: 6400 a + 80 b + 200 = 100 → 6400 a + 80 b = −100.
    - From t=120: 14400 a + 120 b + 200 = 75 → 14400 a +120 b = −125.
    - Solve these to get a = 1/192 ≈ 0.005208333, b = −5/3 ≈ −1.6666667. Thus T_q(t) = (1/192) t^2 − (5/3) t + 200.
  - Exponential form (general): T_exp(t) = A + B e^{−k t}. Using t = 0 gives A + B = 200.

Step 2: Question Interpretation.
- (a) Identify which graph among A, B, C corresponds to the linear model, the quadratic model and the exponential model.
- (b) Decide which of the three models best describes the sample temperature for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s, and explain why the other models do not fit well for that time range.

Step 3: Mathematical Formulation.
- (a) Map each labeled curve to model type by identifying straight vs curved vs asymptoting shape.
- (b) Evaluate model behaviour across 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 by:
  - Using the linear model T_lin(t) = 200 − (25/24) t to predict long-time behaviour (e.g., at t = 250).
  - Using the quadratic model T_q(t) found above to determine its vertex (where it turns around) and value at t = 250.
  - Using the exponential form T_exp(t) = A + B e^{−k t}; find A, B, k that fit the early data (use the first three points to determine A, B, k) and use that to predict T at larger t (e.g., t = 250). Compare predictions and physical reasonableness (temperature should not go negative or rise after cooling starts; expect asymptote near room temperature).

Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation.
(a) Identification (from Step 1 observations)
- C is linear (straight line).
- A is quadratic (parabolic, has a minimum then rises).
- B is exponential (monotonic decay approaching a horizontal asymptote).

(b) Quantitative checks and predictions

1) Linear model:
- From t = 0 and t = 120 we computed slope m = (75 − 200)/120 = −125/120 = −25/24.
- Linear model: T_lin(t) = 200 − (25/24) t.
- Predict at t = 250: T_lin(250) = 200 − (25/24)·250 = 200 − (25·250)/24 = 200 − 6250/24 = 200 − 260.4166667 = −60.4166667 °C.
- Conclusion: Linear model predicts a physically impossible negative temperature for t = 250 s (given cooling to room temperature), so it is not realistic over the full 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s.

2) Quadratic model (detailed solving):
- Using T_q(t) = a t^2 + b t + c and data:
  - c = 200
  - 6400 a + 80 b = −100
  - 14400 a +120 b = −125
- Solve: multiply first equation by 1.5 → 9600 a +120 b = −150. Subtract the second:
  - (9600−14400) a = −150 − (−125) → −4800 a = −25 → a = 25/4800 = 1/192 ≈ 0.005208333.
  - Then 6400 a = 6400/192 = 33.333333, so 80 b = −100 − 33.333333 = −133.333333 → b = −133.333333/80 = −5/3 ≈ −1.6666667.
- So T_q(t) = (1/192) t^2 − (5/3) t + 200.
- Vertex (time of minimum): t_vertex = −b/(2a) = (5/3) / (2/192) = (5/3) / (1/96) = (5/3)·96 = 160 s.
- Value at vertex: T_q(160) = (1/192)(160^2) − (5/3)(160) + 200 = 133.3333 − 266.6667 + 200 = 66.6666... ≈ 66.7 °C (minimum).
- Predict at t = 250: T_q(250) = (1/192)·62500 − (5/3)·250 + 200 = 325.5208 − 416.6667 + 200 = 108.8541 °C ≈ 108.9 °C.
- Conclusion: the quadratic model has a minimum at t ≈ 160 s and then predicts temperature increasing afterward (e.g., ≈ 108.9 °C at t = 250 s). That contradicts expected monotonic cooling to room temperature, so the quadratic is not realistic for the whole interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s.

3) Exponential model (determine A, B, k using three data points):
- Form T_exp(t) = A + B e^{−k t}. From t = 0: A + B = 200 ⇒ B = 200 − A.
- For t = 40: A + (200 − A) e^{−40k} = 140 ⇒ (200 − A) e^{−40k} = 140 − A.  (1)
- For t = 80: A + (200 − A) e^{−80k} = 100 ⇒ (200 − A) e^{−80k} = 100 − A.  (2)
- Dividing (2) by (1): e^{−80k}/e^{−40k} = (100 − A)/(140 − A) ⇒ e^{−40k} = (100 − A)/(140 − A).
  But from (1) e^{−40k} = (140 − A)/(200 − A). Set equal by consistency with (2) and (1) squared relation:
  Alternatively use relation derived by elimination:
  ((140 − A)^2)/(200 − A) = (100 − A)  (equating (140−A)^2/(200−A) = 100−A).
- Solve for A:
  Expand and simplify:
  (140 − A)^2 = (100 − A)(200 − A).
  Left: 19600 − 280 A + A^2. Right: 20000 − 300 A + A^2.
  Cancel A^2: 19600 − 280 A = 20000 − 300 A → 20 A = 400 → A = 20 °C.
- Then B = 200 − A = 180 °C.
- From (1): (200 − 20) e^{−40k} = 140 − 20 → 180 e^{−40k} = 120 → e^{−40k} = 120/180 = 2/3.
- Thus k = −(1/40) ln(2/3) = (1/40) ln(3/2) ≈ 0.0101366 s^{−1}.
- Exponential model (closed form): T_exp(t) = 20 + 180 e^{−k t}. Using the discrete step form: since e^{−40k} = 2/3 we can also write T_exp(t) = 20 + 180 (2/3)^{t/40}.
- Check at t = 120 using this exponential: T_exp(120) = 20 + 180 (2/3)^{3} = 20 + 180·8/27 = 20 + 53.3333 = 73.3333 °C (close to the measured 75 °C).
- Predict at t = 250: T_exp(250) = 20 + 180 (2/3)^{250/40} = 20 + 180 (2/3)^{6.25}.
  Compute (2/3)^{6.25} = exp(6.25 ln(2/3)) ≈ exp(6.25·(−0.4054651)) = exp(−2.5341569) ≈ 0.07934.
  So T_exp(250) ≈ 20 + 180·0.07934 ≈ 20 + 14.2812 ≈ 34.28 °C.
- Conclusion: exponential model decays monotonically and approaches the asymptote A = 20 °C (room temperature). It stays positive, does not increase after initial cooling, and gives reasonable predictions at larger times.

Step 5: Final Answer.
(a) Identification:
- A is the quadratic model.
- B is the exponential model.
- C is the linear model.

(b) Best model for 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s and explanation:
- The exponential model (B) best describes the temperature over 0 ≤ t ≤ 250 s.
  - It fits the early data with an asymptotic approach to room temperature (A = 20 °C from the fit) and remains physically realistic (monotonic cooling toward the ambient temperature).
  - The linear model (C) continues decreasing at a constant rate and predicts T ≈ −60.42 °C at t = 250 s, which is physically unreasonable for a sample cooling to room temperature.
  - The quadratic model (A) has a minimum at t ≈ 160 s (T ≈ 66.7 °C) and then increases for larger t; at t = 250 s it predicts T ≈ 108.9 °C — this rise after initial cooling is not physically realistic for this scenario.
- Numerical predictions for comparison at t = 250 s:
  - Linear: T_lin(250) ≈ −60.42 °C (unphysical).
  - Quadratic: T_q(250) ≈ 108.85 °C (rises, unphysical for cooling).
  - Exponential: T_exp(250) ≈ 34.28 °C (reasonable approach toward room temperature).

  - Temperatures shown at other altitudes:

    - 2 000 m → 17°C
    - 3 000 m → 10.5°C
  - Given average rate of change: temperature decreases 6.5°C per 1 000 m.
