Chapter 1_Q1.png,"No. The pizza with diameter of 30 cm is more
worth it.",4,Variation,English,yes,4,"Let's analyze whether the price of the pizza varies directly with the surface area.
The area of a circle is given by A = πr^2, where r is the radius.

Pizza 1:
Diameter = 15 cm, so radius r1 = 15/2 = 7.5 cm
Area A1 = π * (7.5)^2 = π * 56.25 ≈ 176.71 cm^2
Price P1 = RM12
Price per cm^2 = 12/176.71 ≈ 0.0679 RM/cm^2

Pizza 2:
Diameter = 23 cm, so radius r2 = 23/2 = 11.5 cm
Area A2 = π * (11.5)^2 = π * 132.25 ≈ 415.48 cm^2
Price P2 = RM25
Price per cm^2 = 25/415.48 ≈ 0.0602 RM/cm^2

Pizza 3:
Diameter = 30 cm, so radius r3 = 30/2 = 15 cm
Area A3 = π * (15)^2 = π * 225 ≈ 706.86 cm^2
Price P3 = RM35
Price per cm^2 = 35/706.86 ≈ 0.0495 RM/cm^2

Since the price per cm^2 is different for each pizza, the price does not vary directly with the surface area.

To determine which pizza is the best value, we compare the price per cm^2.
Pizza 1: 0.0679 RM/cm^2
Pizza 2: 0.0602 RM/cm^2
Pizza 3: 0.0495 RM/cm^2

The pizza with the lowest price per cm^2 is the best value.
Therefore, Pizza 3 (30 cm diameter) is the best value.

Chapter 1_Q2.png,7 cm,3,Variation,English,yes,3,"Let L be the area of a semicircle and d be its diameter.
Given that L varies directly as the square of d, we can write:
L = k * d^2, where k is the constant of proportionality.

We are given that when L = 3.08 cm^2, d = 2.8 cm.
Plugging these values into the equation:
3.  08 = k * (2.8)^2
4.  08 = k * 7.84
k = 3.08 / 7.84
k = 0.392857...
k = 11/28

Now we have the relationship: L = (11/28) * d^2

We need to find the value of d when L = 19.25 cm^2.
19.  25 = (11/28) * d^2
d^2 = 19.25 * (28/11)
d^2 = (19.25 * 28) / 11
d^2 = 539 / 11
d^2 = 49

(b) The area of the curved surface will

Therefore, we can write the relationship as:
A = krs, where k is the constant of proportionality.

Given: A = 88 cm² when r = 3.5 cm and s = 8 cm.
We can use this information to find the value of k.
88 = k * 3.5 * 8
88 = 28k
k = 88/28
k = 22/7 = π (approximately)

(a) Calculate the value of A when r = 5 cm and s = 9.8 cm.
A = krs
A = (22/7) * 5 * 9.8
A = (22/7) * 49
A = 22 * 7
A = 154

Therefore, when r = 5 cm and s = 9.8 cm, A = 154 cm².

(b) What is the change in the area of the curved surface if the slant height decreases and the base radius is fixed?
Since A = krs, where k is a constant and r is fixed, then A is directly proportional to s.
If the slant height (s) decreases, the area of the curved surface (A) will also decrease.
The decrease in A is directly proportional to the decrease in s, provided that r is constant.
Specifically, if the slant height decreases, the area will decrease linearly.
The change in the area depends on how much the slant height decreases by.
Since the area is directly proportional to the slant height when the radius is fixed, if the slant height decreases, the area of the curved surface will decrease.

From the protein information, we have:
6x + 4y = 16

So, the two linear equations are:
6x + 4y = 16
95x + 110y = 300

Then AX = B, so X = A⁻¹B

First, we find the determinant of A:
det(A) = (6 * 110) - (4 * 95) = 660 - 380 = 280

Next, we find the inverse of A:
A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) | 110  -4 | = (1/280) | 110  -4 |

(b) Calculating the overall marks for Mathematics using the matrix method:

To calculate the overall marks for Mathematics, we will use the first row of the Marks matrix and multiply it by the Weightage matrix.

Mathematics Marks = (80 * 0.6) + (70 * 0.4)
                   = 48 + 28

The original position is (5, 0). The diameter of the circular formation is 10 m, so the radius is 5 m. The original position is 9 m from the field boundary. This means the field boundary is at x = 5 + 9 = 14.

The band member moved 300 degrees clockwise.  Since the radius of the circle is 5, the x and y coordinates of the new position relative to the center (0,0) can be calculated.  300 degrees clockwise is the same as 60 degrees counter-clockwise.
x = r * cos(theta) = 5 * cos(300) = 5 * cos(60) = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5

For Wildan, at 15.45 m, the cumulative frequency is approximately 8.

The total number of throws is 20 (since the ogive reaches a maximum cumulative frequency of 20).

For Rozaidy, the number of throws exceeding 15.45 m is 20 - 12 = 8.
The percentage of throws exceeding 15.45 m for Rozaidy is (8/20) * 100% = 40%.

For Wildan, the number of throws exceeding 15.45 m is 20 - 8 = 12.
The percentage of throws exceeding 15.45 m for Wildan is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.

(b) To determine who performed better based on the median and the third quartile, we need to find these values from the graph.

Median (Q2): The median is the value at which the cumulative frequency is half of the total, which is 20/2 = 10.
From the graph:
For Rozaidy, the median is approximately 14.45 m.
For Wildan, the median is approximately 15.15 m.

Third Quartile (Q3): The third quartile is the value at which the cumulative frequency is 3/4 of the total, which is (3/4) * 20 = 15.
From the graph:
For Rozaidy, the third quartile is approximately 16.25 m.
For Wildan, the third quartile is approximately 16.75 m.

Comparison:
Rozaidy: Median = 14.45 m, Q3 = 16.25 m
Wildan: Median = 15.15 m, Q3 = 16.75 m

Since both the median and the third quartile are higher for Wildan than Rozaidy, Wildan performed better during the training session.

and 8.9 mmol/L are lower because the
dispersion of the data is smaller.",6,"Measures of Dispersion for
Grouped Data",English,yes,6,"Here's the solution to the problem:

(a) Based on the histogram, the distribution is not symmetrical. A symmetrical distribution would have a mirror image on both sides of the center. This histogram is skewed to the left because the tail extends more to the left.

(b) To calculate the mean and standard deviation, we first need to determine the frequencies and midpoints of each class interval.

Class Intervals | Midpoint (x) | Frequency (f)
------- | -------- | --------
2.95 - 3.95 | 3.45 | 4
3.95 - 4.95 | 4.45 | 10
4.95 - 5.95 | 5.45 | 20
5.95 - 6.95 | 6.45 | 27
6.95 - 7.95 | 7.45 | 40
7.95 - 8.95 | 8.45 | 30

Now, we can calculate the mean (μ):
μ = Σ(f * x) / Σf

Σf = 4 + 10 + 20 + 27 + 40 + 30 = 131

Σ(f * x) = (4 * 3.45) + (10 * 4.45) + (20 * 5.45) + (27 * 6.45) + (40 * 7.45) + (30 * 8.45)
= 13.8 + 44.5 + 109 + 174.15 + 298 + 253.5 = 892.95

μ = 892.95 / 131 = 6.816 (approx)

Next, we calculate the standard deviation (σ):

First, we need to find Σ[f * (x - μ)^2]

Class Intervals | Midpoint (x) | Frequency (f) | x - μ | (x - μ)^2 | f * (x - μ)^2
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
2.95 - 3.95 | 3.45 | 4 | -3.366 | 11.329 | 45.316
3.95 - 4.95 | 4.45 | 10 | -2.366 | 5.598 | 55.98
4.95 - 5.95 | 5.45 | 20 | -1.366 | 1.866 | 37.32
5.95 - 6.95 | 6.45 | 27 | -0.366 | 0.134 | 3.618
6.95 - 7.95 | 7.45 | 40 | 0.634 | 0.402 | 16.08
7.95 - 8.95 | 8.45 | 30 | 1.634 | 2.669 | 80.07

Σ[f * (x - μ)^2] = 45.316 + 55.98 + 37.32 + 3.618 + 16.08 + 80.07 = 238.384

σ = sqrt(Σ[f * (x - μ)^2] / (Σf -1 ))
σ = sqrt(238.384 / 130) = sqrt(1.8337) = 1.354 (approx)

Therefore, the mean is approximately 6.816 and the standard deviation is approximately 1.354.

(c) We need to calculate the standard deviation of the blood glucose readings between 6.0 mmol/L and 8.9 mmol/L. This means we are considering the class intervals 5.95-6.95, 6.95-7.95, and 7.95-8.95.

New data set:
Class Intervals | Midpoint (x) | Frequency (f)
------- | -------- | --------
5.95 - 6.95 | 6.45 | 27
6.95 - 7.95 | 7.45 | 40
7.95 - 8.95 | 8.45 | 30

Σf = 27 + 40 + 30 = 97

Σ(f * x) = (27 * 6.45) + (40 * 7.45) + (30 * 8.45)
= 174.15 + 298 + 253.5 = 725.65

μ = 725.65 / 97 = 7.481 (approx)

Next, we calculate the standard deviation (σ):

First, we need to find Σ[f * (x - μ)^2]

Class Intervals | Midpoint (x) | Frequency (f) | x - μ | (x - μ)^2 | f * (x - μ)^2
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
5.95 - 6.95 | 6.45 | 27 | -1.031 | 1.063 | 28.701
6.95 - 7.95 | 7.45 | 40 | -0.031 | 0.001 | 0.04
7.95 - 8.95 | 8.45 | 30 | 0.969 | 0.939 | 28.17

Σ[f * (x - μ)^2] = 28.701 + 0.04 + 28.17 = 56.911

σ = sqrt(Σ[f * (x - μ)^2] / (Σf - 1))
σ = sqrt(56.911 / 96) = sqrt(0.59282) = 0.770 (approx)

The standard deviation for the readings between 6.0 mmol/L and 8.9 mmol/L is approximately 0.770.

Comparing this to the standard deviation calculated in (b), 1.354, we see that the standard deviation is smaller when considering only the readings between 6.0 mmol/L and 8.9 mmol/L. This is because the data is more concentrated around the mean in this smaller range. By excluding the lower glucose readings, we are reducing the spread of the data, which results in a lower standard deviation.",3975,SUCCESS,gemini-2.0-flash

Grouped Data",English,yes,7,"Okay, I will calculate the mean and standard deviation for the 'before' and 'after' data.  Then I will analyze the results to determine if the medicine is effective.

Step 1: Calculate the midpoints of each blood pressure range.
120-134: (120+134)/2 = 127
135-149: (135+149)/2 = 142
150-164: (150+164)/2 = 157
165-179: (165+179)/2 = 172

Step 2: Calculate the mean for the 'before' data.
Mean = (4*127 + 7*142 + 8*157 + 6*172) / (4+7+8+6)
Mean = (508 + 994 + 1256 + 1032) / 25
Mean = 3790 / 25
Mean = 151.6

Step 3: Calculate the mean for the 'after' data.
Mean = (9*127 + 8*142 + 7*157 + 1*172) / (9+8+7+1)
Mean = (1143 + 1136 + 1099 + 172) / 25
Mean = 3550 / 25
Mean = 142

Step 4: Calculate the standard deviation for the 'before' data.
Variance = [4*(127-151.6)^2 + 7*(142-151.6)^2 + 8*(157-151.6)^2 + 6*(172-151.6)^2] / 25
Variance = [4*605.16 + 7*92.16 + 8*29.16 + 6*416.16] / 25
Variance = [2420.64 + 645.12 + 233.28 + 2496.96] / 25
Variance = 5796 / 25
Variance = 231.84
Standard Deviation = sqrt(231.84) = 15.226

Step 5: Calculate the standard deviation for the 'after' data.
Variance = [9*(127-142)^2 + 8*(142-142)^2 + 7*(157-142)^2 + 1*(172-142)^2] / 25
Variance = [9*225 + 8*0 + 7*225 + 1*900] / 25
Variance = [2025 + 0 + 1575 + 900] / 25
Variance = 4500 / 25
Variance = 180
Standard Deviation = sqrt(180) = 13.416

Step 6:  Analyze the results and justify the answer.

Before:
Mean = 151.6
Standard Deviation = 15.226

After:
Mean = 142
Standard Deviation = 13.416

The mean blood pressure decreased from 151.6 to 142 after taking the medicine.  This is a decrease of 9.6 mmHg. Since the mean blood pressure is lower after taking the medication, and the standard deviations are similar, it suggests that the medicine is effective in lowering blood pressure for this group of patients.

Final Answer:
Mean (Before) = 151.6, Standard Deviation (Before) = 15.226
Mean (After) = 142, Standard Deviation (After) = 13.416

Yes, the medicine appears to be effective in lowering the blood pressure of the group of patients. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 9.6 mmHg after taking the medicine.

**(a) Determine the function that represents the arc of the main cable.**

We can model the arc of the main cable as a parabola.  Let's place the vertex of the parabola at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system. This point is the lowest point of the main cable. Since the shortest distance from the main cable to the deck is 5m, that means the y coordinate of the vertex from the deck is 5. The total height of the tower is 35m, therefore the distance from the vertex to the top of the tower is 30m. The length of the bridge is 600m, so each tower is at x = -300 and x = 300.
The general form of a parabola with its vertex at the origin is y = ax^2. We know that at x = 300, y = 30.  We can use this information to find the value of 'a'.

30 = a(300)^2
30 = a(90000)
a = 30/90000
a = 1/3000

So, the function that represents the arc of the main cable is y = (1/3000)x^2.  Since the origin is 5m below the deck, we need to vertically translate it up by 5, giving the main cable relative to the deck the function:

y = (1/3000)x^2 + 5

**(b) If the suspender cables are 20 m apart, determine the number of suspender cables needed on both sides of the bridge.**

The bridge is 600 meters long.  The suspender cables are 20 meters apart.

Number of intervals = Total length / Distance between cables
Number of intervals = 600 m / 20 m = 30 intervals

Since we need a cable at the beginning and end of each interval, the number of cables on one side is the number of intervals plus one.

Number of cables on one side = 30 + 1 = 31

Since there are two sides to the bridge, the total number of suspender cables is:

Total number of cables = 31 * 2 = 62

Therefore, 62 suspender cables are needed on both sides of the bridge.

*   **Linear Model:** A linear model is represented by a straight line. In the graph, line **C** appears to be a straight line. So, **C** is the linear model.

*   **Quadratic Model:** A quadratic model is represented by a parabola (a U-shaped curve). In the graph, curve **A** is a parabola. So, **A** is the quadratic model.

*   **Exponential Model:** An exponential model shows a decreasing rate of change, which means the graph will decrease rapidly at first and then level off. In the graph, curve **B** is an exponential model.

Therefore:
A - Quadratic Model
B - Exponential Model
C - Linear Model

(b) Determining the best model for the temperature data:

Looking at the table:

*   At t = 0, T = 200
*   At t = 40, T = 140
*   At t = 80, T = 100
*   At t = 120, T = 75

The temperature is decreasing, but the rate of decrease is slowing down as time increases. Exponential decay is the behavior seen here.

Comparing the three models in the graph with this behavior:

*   The quadratic model (A) starts decreasing and then starts increasing.
*   The linear model (C) shows a constant rate of decrease, which is not what is observed in the data.
*   The exponential model (B) shows a decreasing rate of change, which matches the behavior seen in the data.

Thus, the exponential model (B) best describes the temperature of the sample for the range of times 0 ≤ t ≤ 250.

Reasons why the other models do not fit well:

*   Linear Model (C): The temperature decreases at a constant rate. The data shows that the rate of cooling slows down with time, which is not consistent with a linear model.
*   Quadratic Model (A): The temperature initially decreases and then increases, but the temperature will continuously decrease, not increase.

Final Answer:
(a) A - Quadratic Model, B - Exponential Model, C - Linear Model
(b) Model B (Exponential Model) best describes the temperature. The linear model has a constant rate of cooling and the quadratic model starts increasing with time.",2362,SUCCESS,gemini-2.0-flash

T(x) = initial temperature + (rate of change) * x
